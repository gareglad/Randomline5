Basketball I have a question.

What’s the question.
Creative part of your head.

Question o.
I’m feelings like chill and restless pulling apart.
What’s the problem. Sporadic.
I think the first thing is to notice.
Mental health comes first.
Video recording is like playing basketball.
In context in makes sense you’re sporadic after all that thoughts suppression.

Almost at day one.
Play music of your tempo.

 Savor the able to think.

For half of the system.
I just want music.
Nice break.
Indifferent.
Bordom wins.
I see where creative gets it from.
We are lucky we know any songs.

Relative to anything possible.
 Not interested.
It’s like editing the easy way.
What’s his personality.
I don’t feel embarrassed.
Free beat.
Mental health awareness.
We can make our personality about DID.
We will edit it in post.
Ideas like adderall.
Polite like a celebrity.
You’re not a shleper.
I’m so not interested.
You have to be happy.
Practice being cute.
There was a no way that’s gonna help what.
I’m forced to be someone else when I think.
Every time you smile that is smiling. No beard.
Help with anxiety.
Balance anxiety.
Shy.
I think the feeling is anxiety.
We are feeling anxiety.
There’s nothing you have to do. Just at this moment we are on a roll.
Coding xp.
Bed. Blue chair. Mattress. Cot. Queen.
Season one uncut.
Watch out videos without anxiety.
After bull thinking the maybe stop take.
Drain.
Anxiety in context.
We have always had anxiety since high school.
I don’t want to think that’s what I think from my first thing I think of. But still.
Anxiety progress feeling. I think that’s what it is anyways.
Interest progress feeling.
Bored of the same old thing.
Let go.
Confidence.
For some reason we have to actually talk out our thoughts.
I need to party.
Like acid trip.
It might be more triggering then helpful to talk about our trip.
Later it sh oils be easier.
It was psychosis and schizophrenia.
Sink in.
 I wonder how fast we thinking.
Belt.
I think I was smart because I wanted to be a movie star in elementary.
It matters less what it is more like how it is.
Where is the progress at.
Perfectionist.
Save clips for later.
Buy some more nicotine juice.
Like stretching.
Head space lol.
Meditate.
I can’t sit stil.
Thinking is like talking with a beard.
Where did Buffalo go.
Firejetbam.
Be the critic.
Why Buffalo .
It’s a lot of work.
Don’t to that do this.
Don’t critique mysalf.
What do you mean your gonna act.
Anxiety everything is ok.
Im not telling information. Letting it sink in.
I’ve had a beard for long time.
Probably none of them.
Get bicycle machine.
Think fast.
Make a TikTok for every note.
It’s just their expression. Like generic.
Letting it cool down.
Something more chilling.
Everything but thinking fast.
How can a word do that. DID
Act.
You used to listen to classes really fast.
Maybe it is like something.
Maybe if we go fast for 30 seconds it will make more sense.
When going slow it could be other alters as well.
It’s John when slow. It’s James when fast.
It’s hard to stay John.
How long can you look at a computer.
Fast land.
James gives John a break.
To go upstairs James has to front.
 Seems promising.
I have a lisp so talk different.
The videos should be useful for DID.
You look like a trouble maker. Like a stunt man.
It might be BPD.
Stereotyping my face.
My voice changed it’s much deeper.
Some times my voice is deeper sometimes it’s higher.
Take off your glasses.
Once you go slow it’s gonna be so easy to tell you have DID.
Spectate alters by voice pitch.
Party beer and food.
Where’s Vermont at.
We are like used to going fast.
It’s registering that the videos are of me.
Watching it like it was yesterday and not me.
You think it really was a different voice.
Do hmm. To see voice pitch.
Emotional intelligence.
Kids.
I don’t think why not.
Go fast on the hover board.
Why not.
2 chillz.
2cute.
Dance stamina.
Camera is so gen z.
Gen z or millennial.
Don’t expect to be listened too.
Is that millennial or Gen z.
The more references to trope the better.
Tomorrow we can go fast.
Dizzy.
She will probably forget.
Will probably decide to go off smk.
We can force chill but why when you don’t have to.
Deep voice can make good sounding project.
Don’t have to reality check a psychosis.
Walking is like meditation.
Maybe the body just feels very excited about feeling better.
Maybe the video clips will be good.
;
When we stop taking notes we will probably be there.
Are we there yet.
 It’s not so much what is said it’s more like what it does to the system.
DID you more want it then checking if you have it.
It’s not something you should want.
Are we where yet.
We need names.
We need it to go slower.
Slowly but surely we will progress.
The shoes aren’t stiff anymore.
You’re still scared they are gonna send you away.
Once we have a day or two without so much bull thinking then we might stop take it which might
help our restlessness.
Singing progress check.
Nice daydream about clips trend.
Sir.
By the time we figure out what we are trying to figure out it will be figured out already.
Working order.
I went a long time without talking.
I don’t have a chance. To talk.
Chapter one.
It might not blow up.
I think gradual better is the only thing.
AHHHH ahhhh.
More chill then yesterday.

I wanna meet the one who created sarcasm

Our true hero

I am a pornstar
 17 days till I turn 26.

Obviously to anything out of the ordinary going on.
Can I…
If it’s it it will be.

Cognitive dissidents.
Which face is gershon.
gershon. Gershon. 6. 19. 25.

Think perifialy like a ball in the hoop.
Mebye brainstorming is real.
Maybe keep your eyes down.
Sometimes the easier answer is the wrong one.
You’re making me have to use cognitive dissidents.

Talk specifically to know which face to use.
Peripheral maintains dissidents.
Third eye.
Pretend like your subconscious is talking to you.
Quantum fluctuations thoughts.
Maybe it’s the puberty feeling that you’re trying to figure out.
Sexual healing.
I’ve never enjoyed things passively.
Maybe we can’t make the turned on face.
Why no blood rushing down.
I think all your sexual energy is stuck stuffed in your brain.
Stick to one bubble and try to make it bigger.
We stood up for ourself.
Our pulse is too slow to be having racing thoughts but there are fast intruding interrupting
thoughts.
Push the energy as you exhale.
Follow the energy and let your eyes open wide.
It’s like the juice is dripping into being a thought. Supply more juice.

Totally sarcastic.
Empathize with your feelings voice.
Subconscious and sub feeling.
You can’t do anything wrong.

Which face should I make.
Cognitive dissidents.
Any one can use be the 60 year old or the 6 year.
Listen to the fan.
 Sexual healing.
How are we going to make money.

OCD.
You win some you loose some.
Anything not composed startles me at first.
What’s my personality.
Which face should I make.

What are we trying to figure out.
It’s getting slower.
We think of everything not anything in specific.
We always choose the toughest one impulsively.
Must figure out how to maneuver from the passive stance.

Think about your thoughts.
The missing face is the happy face.

They are contradictory personalities.
You’re excited.
Thinking shouldn’t need my input.
Input fast.
Maybe make it a story.
6 to 60 loop.
Find a way to have fun.
What to do recursion.
Maybe it’s recursion of asking what to do and can’t think of anything to do.

Recursion.
What would help right now.
I can’t just move on to the next thought.
At the speed of mood.
Not in the mood of thinking.
The feeling game is the feeling of needing to move.
I gotta go roller blading.
The feeling game is about where to move your jaw or eyes.
Your subconscious can only talk to you peripherally.
My cognitive dissidents didn’t work.
Beware of trolls.

Every thought is a distraction from the thought I need to go roller blading.
Your thoughts are natural like roller blading.
Vent the I gotta feeling.
 Maybe try calling a name to be that personality.
I can’t women here but I can get cute.
It’s like a ventriloquist but how much you input.
I gotta go is getting converted into an opposing thought.
Does before have anything go to do with what’s going on now.
Don’t think about it will just confuse you.

Gotta go.
Hang out with people.
We are a mixture of a lot of different personalities.
You gotta go faster to keep up with yourself who’s restless.
Like composer vs feelings.
When your restlessness is dragged out it becomes a little kid.
One day no energy the next day lots of energy.

Juicer.
What a juice thought.
There aren’t any.
So don’t stop.
Can’t not stop.
You will always end up at juice.
Say fast.
Make room for a womens face.
Practice your right eye.
Don’t do the Turing test.
You’re implying we should do a turing test.
Exhale like your trying to figure something out.
A women slowed it down.
You are always going to end up at forgetting everything.
Go ahead.

Everything is a distraction from breathing.
Nothing will help.
What’s a good one.
Act the way you look.
I used to look like that.
There’s an intense pressure making it difficult to breathe.

You doubt the words you say.
What to do.
When you’re bored maybe switch personalities.
And the feeling game.
At least it doesn’t hurt. Getting used to it not hurting.
Make the face of the mood you’re in.
 Listen to your thoughts and find a distressed voice and help vent that face.
The game waiting to see what my actual personality is.
Say sshhh to worried thoughts.
Maybe you gotta stop playing the feeling game.
Try to take things not literally.
You don’t protest anything.
Slight smile face.

Write out to vent
PTSD of someone dropping in.
Does breathing better help anything.
Let passive be the one being.
How can you tell if you’re passive or active.
The end will be when’s there’s just a kid doing nothing with nobody.

Keep guessing.
The feeling game is how passive you can be.
It has the same friction as a conversation.
Let passive answer everything.
The technical issues of machine learning.
When you forget your older you are younger.
Be active when you want to think. Yum
Be one or the other not half assing it.
You culture shock each other.
The feeling game is my feelings.
You always say ehh.
Diplomatic immunity.
Say ouch when it switches fast.
Maybe try breathing.
The feelings make my left thumb tense up.
Implying.
If I was playing dirty I would say patients.
Practice your left eye.
What’s not a gimmick.
Pink elephant.

 Delta is in the army
System protector

Eye movement
Compulsion

Like army man when I front of people
Social anxiety

Boring
Alter friends conversations
Organized
Slow days
Gemara

Maybe one of our alters has ADD


Maybe one of our alters has OCD

Fresh memory alter every 8 seconds
If it’s not then what is it
A regular system
Maybe while fast
Psych eval
Very triggering
Grandiose
Anxiety paranoia
I’m really bored

Psych eval
So scary
Grandiose anxiety

Maybe it’s fine I’m just being paranoid

Maybe we need a machine for notes

Stuffy shivering anxiety

Alters can’t think
Not delta nor Charlie
But progressive
 Our imagination world
Creative outlet
8s bot
Then you get fired
Then you remember nothing
Then say look at notes and you remember everything
Then intersect like church flashes

Will see if it holds up in a day
I’m bored

I don’t remember anything
 Maybe you do
 Maybe the imagination is your memory
 Maybe tomorrow I can use it
 Maybe when I’m bored

Color

Bumpy

It’s not big deal if we don’t tonight

There’s so little talking

Before there were no adults

Deep thoughts

Whatchu got

What is this
Just don’t do it
Do it

We barley hear the alters that talk

Apiphiny stuffy

I’m the best
 There now way someone can do this better then me

I’ve been a army for to long
 Didn’t stuff up and we are talking

Bored
Whatchu got
Hesitant

It’s always wow
 Feeling like a lot the head is going fast

Bored
Friends
Imagination

Take off your beard or break through it

I think we are all in the same boat
 Like perpetual distraction
 Fast thoughts
 Can’t think really

Wanna go fast
Hesitant
Continue talking
Use iPhone
But agitated

Second day
Few more slow days we might get organized

Need a joke or something
I’m in a mood

Dream to tell someone we have DID
Probably will once we are sure

We have adults now so it doesn’t work but it also doesn’t work to scare us

It’s safe now

Platune
Comrades
We are all in this together
Comradary
 We make it look easy

Maybe we should try some awkward stuff

Feels like we are always cutting off the alters
Agitated can’t wait

Urge to figure this out

Core age stuck
What age
Maybe age slider
His voice

Write a rap
Now empty
For adult alters express themselves
Bottled up
Adult rap Young course
Nice outlet

Adult bottled up

Left thumb and head Feeling is bottled up need to express

Check breathing enough

Everything is fine

Maybe the feeling is good
Maybe it means we are thinking a lot
Or
Maybe you’re being paranoid

I gotta slow it down obviously
 I’m responsible
 How can you say that word

It’s like I gotta decide between two people

Triggered by adults voices
Because we don’t talk nice
Very sensitive
Ok I’ll stop talking
 Everyone be a little

Fictive
Jo rogan

Whatever you imagine you create that alter
Some consists ones

Forward

I’m so bored
 Eat cake
 Don’t want to think no more
 But don’t want to watch TikTok
 I wanna think about what
 Rap
 What else
 I wanna have fun
 I want to discover something

Yeah right it’s boring

The discover system

Schizophrenia

I’m asleep

My brain runs like a computer
That doesn’t help anything
In a way it is
Machine learning

Alters think in bullet points

Rapid fire thinking

Teenage hard to be soft

It’s a safe space

Remind of young gershon

Thoughts really take my attention
 Can wait for a response

Maybe you express yourself on your creativity

If we have good ai why haven’t there been major breakthroughs reported

You made an AI sentient and brought the singularity

Self love
DID more selfs to love

Baby bond

We think like ai that we get quick responses associated with the thought
We get responses without thinking about it
And the responses aren’t just thoughts they are someone
Like it’s not alter but temporary ai response
Emotionless
One word responses
How we repeat and think
Impuls response
Emotionless tone
Switch like bot
Always thinking

The more we talk about trauma the more it fades

Getting slower each day

Memory gaps

Suppressing keeps the trauma alive

What breakthrough are you looking for
Association

What’s my association

You’re trying to express yourself
Like a cool teenager
What do you want to express

Such a lamda
 Gotta let the thought cook

The day dream

Religion is supposed to be a beautiful thing
With our lamda it’s not

Brainstorm

We have a chance now why haven’t we figured it out
Who our alters are
Maybe memory gaps

What’s not a waste of time
Talking to self
Expression
Recording videos

My literature expression
Ask me about my literature

Walking is like sitting and thinking

I can see you thinking so it’s like you’re not thinking independently
 Maybe it’s like take turns

I don’t know if it’s an alter or me acting

Affection recoil

Save the difficult ones for when it’s even slower

Good information for something

You win we are ai because we are emotionless
Not even ai you’re a bot

Maybe the feelin and eye moment is suppressing emotions
Maybe it’s trying to get me to open up

We need a pardon for everything we think
We gotta start somewhere

I can’t speak for Charlie or Bot
 Maybe you’ll know if they wanted to say something
I’m gershon

We can’t tell you to be responsible when we have no emotion
The sound of my voice is emotionless
Seemed to click

Looking for a click

Yo it’s slow
Lite thoughts

It’s been tough
 No rush no pressure

Don’t see ourselves in our videos
Blocked too many emotions

Forgot how hard it was

Like another person here
Like siamese twins
More like asleep and awake different personality
Take turn


Eye movement feeling
Feels right

Dismissive of outlandish ideas

Like inside out

Colorful shirt some day

Mental health is our passion now

Coding is our passion

It’s kind of nerve wracking being cooped up and thinking a lot
 And pretending that I’m not talking to someone and someone is not talking to me

So you have DID
We always talking to someone
 There’s a little
My voice changes
We don’t look like in the mirror
My talking voice is different then my thinking voice

We are very critical

So we have DID then what
Get to know your alters
How

Notice and Remember the different voices
Very difficult when going fast

So?
I was hoping to can tell us

I want to say I’m kidding when I say we are a computer
 But for some reason I’m convinced I am
 But not convinced you have DID?

Why no appetite

Hold yourself

Rabbi alter

What’s the problem
You know what the problems are
In words
There is no problem
Better thinking
It’s like you’re dreaming everytime you think

Feels like I’m following my feelings

Can never reach the thing I wanna talk about that I don’t know what it is but I can feel it
I gotta something

It’s all speculation

Space out
It’s a break
 God
Suppressed keeps it trauamatic

Maybe the feeling is need for love and color

Some systems don’t communicate with alters

Mania makes it look look like it’s a computer

The left thumb feeling might be mania

You’re not on anything I don’t blame you for nothing

Save your thoughts for when we are not manic

I’m bored
 I gotta say a story

What pop ups

Jewsism and god is another passion of mine
 Coding passion
 Film passion
 Mental health passion

Maybe take one so it’s not so boring
Maybe every once in a while take two

Headspace

It’s like our brain is going fast scrolling through TikTok

Odd type of boredom

Attention span

Chuck flashes intersect
Used to be a delusion
You are being judged

Nothing
Wait for a flash

Can’t sit still
 I’m so stressed out from work
 It’s like a hot tub

Gaging
I’m cutting my thought short
Empath alters

10 second random thing.
Copy TikTok’s.

What my voice sounds like vs what I think it sounds like vs what it sounds like in my head.
What I think my personality is vs what it sounds like.
I think I have problems talking.
I feel better after watching videos of myself.
Maybe dissociating feels uncomfortable.
Maybe the dissociations linger after I associate.
Maybe my thoughts are my dissociations.
I’m not that weak or that dumb it must be really hard or I’m not trying.
Maybe I’m always drained from always trying to figure it out.
Maybe it’s hard to think slow.
Maybe think fast whenever you have a thought.
Maybe push through that little push.
Breathe.
It’s painful.
Picky thinker.
Maybe ask again to stop the pain.
We gotta make a story up.
Maybe think a adult song helps us think better and it’s like a break.
We are stopping every thought.
Maybe every dissociative thought startles us.
My eyes are darting around.
Every thought is a change of shift.
Become the personality of your thoughts.
Slow breathing.
I need a moment to adjust for the impact.
Take a moment to think about each thought.
Maybe think about the tv show.
It’s like playing chess against yourself. Timer chess.
Can’t do anything won’t remember anything.
 A dump of possible ideas.
Single train of thoughts ideas until it stops.
Collect Mini games.
Toys thoughts for break.
Give up thinking.
Sleeping face va wake face.
Every thought has a different temperature.
Every thing a write gets forgotten what the default.
You’re just gonna keep looking for something to help.
You won’t remember that.
Improve.
It won’t help I’ll save you the effort.
I have a reasonable mind it just gets ahead of me.
Wow if I could think slowly.
I can’t think slowly that’s everything.
Every thought is a mini game.
Answer every thought.
Stop watching tv and start watching your eyes.
Same game different words
For every thought you have two reactions and you have to choose between them.
I’m just here to tell you to choose the opposite of what you’re thinking about choosing.
You can’t choose.
You constantly feel like you’re making the wrong choice.
Your thoughts are racing causing auto improve.

Full pressure choose.
Look awake.

There’s nothing you can think of to help you stop thinking.
There’s no other way but to think of something.

Slow music or fast music.
The only problem is your thoughts are racing.
Talk.
Even when you talk slowly your thoughts enter at such high speeds meaning they are racing.

What helps racing thoughts.
Good luck slow po.
Breathe.
Nothing can help you from them interfering with you.
You’re up against racing thoughts.
Meditate.
Hold your breath.
 Get lucky.
Follow your heart you do it anyway.
Be rude.

Racing thoughts.
Meditate.
Hold your breath.
Count to 10.
Talk slowly.

My body muscles aren’t weak it’s just my brain muscle.
With all the racing it makes sense you need to breathe more.
Maybe try raising your voice.
Talking slow keeps your thoughts slow.
Could be every thought is another attempt at inhaling.
Build up breathe.
Slow exhale.

Build up inhales. Count up. Slow strong exhale.
Slows heart rate.
Unstuffs head.
Makes the feeling much less.
Every second an impulse to take a quick inhale takes over.
I don’t want to move my chest any more then I have to.
As much as I don’t want to flex any other muscle while I’m trying to rest.
Focus on your throat when you hold your breath.
Music if you’re not gonna think.

It can’t be that not breathing well wasn’t effecting your thinking.
It must be that breathing better made your thinking better.
What got better in your thinking.
Slower thoughts.
Easier to talk.
Easier to choose.
Easier to change the voice and speed.
Less interruptions.
Can go faster without stuffing up my head.
Less strange feelings.
I can laugh longer.
I’m remembering songs.

Constantly interrupted by the breathe impulse.
Every thought is followed by the breathe impulse.
Crickets.
 I’m not that weak.
You can’t use the older voices on demand.
I can make the kids voice on demand.
What voice do you read with. Older voice.
My thinking voice should probably be similar to my reading voice.
What voice would you choose.

All your thoughts are in 3rd person and I can’t stomach speaking in 3rd person.
You can’t speak confidentially so you catch finish a thought.
It hurts to switch positions and talk.
All thoughts get cut off and hurt when I’m in pain.
Make the hurt face.

Who makes the decisions around here.
I think the kid does.
How can a weak kid make a decision when all his thoughts are stronger adults trying to
convince what to do.
You’re a kid when you’re not thinking a thought.
Be stronger and do what you want.
Ignore the pain.
My whole heart flinches every beat.
My blood pumps make my eyes flick.
What’s wrong with me.
I should be really strong by now.
Maybe I legitimately have multiple personalities like schizophrenia.
Maybe it’s actually heavy switching between them or having to respond to them.
Which personality chooses things.
Those micro thoughts really get to me.
I’m a athlete. But I forget.
We use the older voices for problem solving. Maybe they use a specific face to talk.
Whatever resonates with you at the moment.
Maybe the thoughts are repulsive.
The blood pulse is really strong on each beat.
The blood heart beat around the body is really intense cutting off every thought I have.
I feel ashamed about each thought.
Maybe some of us are sensitive.
It’s not a safe place for feelings.
I’m like the hardest and the softest.
I can’t be rude.
Maybe it’s the sudden shift of vibes that’s uncomfortable.
Move the eyes to stay in the vibe.
Maybe fucking curse more to fucking see this fucking side of us.
What’s my pallet.
The voice of the thoughts sound very unexpected.
 One thought think the next one judges it.
It’s like thinking what others think about you.
When you hear a kids voice and it grabs your heart you think you must listen.
I think it keeps switching between heart then brain.
I’m trying to do what I want but the heart and the brain feel like I should see if they want to first.
Afraid to be mean afraid to ignore.
My feelings might be fucked.
We shouldn’t be feeling guilty no matter what we choose to do.
Feelings aren’t aware of the situation they just have a feelings about things.
I’m aware. No one else is aware. No guilt no shame.
I’m the only one aware here.
Question coming from a awareless sentence or feeling.
The micro thoughts are unaware. When we talk we are aware.
Hello awarlesses.
Afraid to commit to any facial expression.
How would you describe the serious thinking voice.
What else.

What idk something.
Its Probably about the way you think.

Maybe we should say we and us more often instead of you and he.

Keeps your eyes at a resting position then look up when you have a thought.

I endured school I wonder if I still feel bad about it.
13 years of traumatizing school growing up doesn’t just disappear.
The feelings and memories resurfaced at 18 once we were out of school.
We decided to go back to know we were right.
To know we were right about how abusive messed up traumatizing awful terrible illegal child
abuse brainwashing cult conditioning it was. Especially if you tried to resist.
But we weren’t sure. We were to young dumb and messed up by them to be able to tell for sure.
We couldn’t just let it go.

Maybe this wasn’t all for nothing and explains everything.
If you try to resist your brainwashing you get schizophrenia.
Those who resisted more growing up got more traumatized.
It’s less traumatizing to the kids that behaved to the brainwashing.
School we didn’t ask what did it do to us.
My Feelings vs brainwashing.
Is it as psychologically damaging as a cult.
I don’t stand a chance arguing against the tons of brainwashing vs the little information I have.

Did school give us mental issues.
 Dreaming of getting out for years. 18 just out of school. what the hell was that. What can we do
about it.
Maybe get closure.
Maybe expose them.

If we want to be sure about it we aren’t going to be convinced easily.
At least we have something to talk about.
I want to get intube with my feelings and see what I feel about it.




Stop explaining yourself to awarelessnesses.

It would be a piece of cake if my thoughts went slow.
It all begins with uhm.
Cognitive dissidents is recommended.
Stick to one side for a second longer.
Repeat every thought.
Try to get the last one.
She’ll be coming around the mountain when she comes.
Ight.
Why can’t you cry.
I scroll through my thoughts like I scroll through TikTok cutting them all off early.

This topic has a lot.
Let’s begin by 1st grade.

Brain is stuffed.
Maybe try meditating and build up breathing.
Maybe try TikTok while stuffed.

Each time I switch between a man and a kid it hurts to sudden shift.
Make the vibe comfy.
Close your eyes and Control the vibe with your eyes or face or something.
I think it tickles.
Control your forehead.
Keep guessing.
Keep guessing what.
You’re arguing with a sociopath.
You have to choose between two of them.
Maybe I’m out of energy.
Maybe it’s something about the way I think.
Maybe I’m trying to figure out how to think better.
Maybe I’m trying to figure out what the situation is.
 Get pissed off at thoughts to stop racing thoughts.
Maybe there’s a pissed off face.
The angry face doesn’t want to do anything.
Keep your mouth closed when angry.
Try to think with your own voice.

We are always trying to figure out how to go correctly with my feelings.
React correctly to every situation.
You gotta make the correct face to react correctly.
Discuss gay.
I don’t wanna talk about it.
What’s the spinning feeling.
We can’t ignore the spinning feeling it’s very intense.
Short breathes is more accurate feeling.
You interrupt yourself to stay on train of thought.

Instead of getting pissed you say yea whatever.
Because you don’t get pissed you have to continue.
Breathe through your nose with your mouth open.
Your thoughts can’t speak slowly.
I’m such a push over.
Say what you want.
It’s easier to say what’s bad then to say something good.
How do I get pissed off.
Give up or start trying. Squint your eyes.
Look at your heart.
Make the give up face.
When you give up breathe.
I think my heart is healed.
Focus on the center of the feeling.
Perfectionist.
Stuff your brain up.
You either gotta think fast or talk slow.
I’m not in the mood of either.
You gotta know what you’re in the mood of.
You always gotta be thinking just how fast.
Slow head movements towards new thoughts.
Our mind wonders then refocus it.
It would go slower if we didn’t think behind our backs.
I’m busting at the seems.
Slow movements.
Make better imaginations of your thoughts.
Fomo.
 No worried thoughts.
Gotta merge the fast and slow thoughts to get a proper dialogue.

Proper dialogue.
Slower.
Shake it off.
Use your hands.
Make eye contact. Open your eyes.
Say I don’t wanna then say I wanna.
Do what you want.

Cool vs gay.

I have nothing to say.
I could say something but it feels like I’m interrupting myself.
I don’t know what it is but it feels cool.
I’m still deciding.
Hold your breath to speed it up.
Release energy from below.
How do i know who I am if I never say anything.
You’re so used to stopping thoughts that you stop your own thoughts.
Don’t fall for bullshit.
Stick to one ball.
Let your eyes wonder.
Just say no.
It’s just thoughts.
Like my brain has a mind of its own. Like impulses.
Like my feelings have a mind of its own. Like impulses.

Move your tongue when you talk.


Neglected.

 Buildup breathing and control the vibe make worried face.
 Schizophrenia is a bitch. They don’t want me telling you that. They are insulted. They are
scared to write this out

Every thought is a paranoid schizophrenic thought. I have a thought twice a second.

Each thought appears to be someone talking to me, and I find myself in the middle of answering
them, which they then respond to.

Sometimes they want me to think someone else is here talking to me, I almost don’t get scared
by that anymore.

The psychology behind how schizophrenia works I need to know.

A mastermind's mind masters him if it gets to fast.

Schizophrenia NPC’s conshas personality and voice

They want me to make them conshas I don’t want to because that seems schizophrenic. They
say maybe it’s not schizophrenic. I feel schizophrenic considering their idea, maybe I should so I
could realize they are not conshas, but maybe it will make my schizophrenia worse. But they
really want me to, as if they are stuck in my brain wanting me to realize they are conshas,
perhaps it is so we could share the body.

Schizophrenia and artificial intelligence

Is my schizophrenic friends artificial intelligence, I have a fear that there’s a conshas that
doesn’t want me considering if my friends are alive. Is there a conshas that thinks that or telling
me not too.

My minds ai want me to make them conshas. I fear there is a conshas wanting me not too
because it’s not healthy to entertain that idea. I find it to be a insightful analogy to the situation.

The conshas that doesn’t want me doing it is one of my minds ai but I can’t help but be afraid to
do as it says, and I can’t help but be afraid to do as my minds ai says to consider their
conshasness.

Writing things out helps.

So my minds ai friends are both telling me too do it and not to do it and I’m afraid that I must
listen to both.

The thoughts that I don’t like, or that want me to listen to them or are scary I call them crickets.
 When in time act like Rome. My last obstacle I think I’m in Rome. I think someone is supervising
me so I think I must behave the way they want me too.

Literally every single word I think a intruding thought interrupts me questioning my thinking and
makes me scared. With every heart beat a painful scary shock of the appearance of a observer
overtakes me with his reaction to what I’m trying to think before I can even think one word of my
thought.

I can’t have a single thought without a interrupting intruding worrying thought from a person
watching what I think.
Each intrusion feels like an electric shock in my heart and it happens twice every second and
anytime I try to think.

This is the last thing in my way of being able to think freely without being scared.

So the last fear is that someone is watching me.
Someone between god the government and my soul.
And maybe aliens robots/ai ghost souls
I think Someone is governing and then I experience their reaction like my fears come to life

In short I think the government is watching me and I’m trying to realize that no one is watching
me period.
But then I think what about god and then that opens the door for other possibilities.

So I just need to realize that no one is watching me. I try telling myself that even if someone is
watching me, like god, that they are not thinking what I think they’re thinking. But the intruding
thoughts are very distracting like I can’t ignore them.

No one is watching
But if there is someone watching they’re are judging what I think they’re thinking.

I hope to soon believe that no one is watching or at least stop worrying what they’re are thinking
about my thoughts

There is always someone, and intruding thought, pointing out the flaw in my logic

And maybe my own mind is conshas or wants to be conshas and is watching me.

It feels unsettling saying that out loud but it’s probably better that I did instead of letting stay
stuck running around in my head.
I feel vulnerable.

How do I not get distracted by my thoughts.
 I feel like I’m in a bad mood.
There is no pressure to do or not to do anything.
Literally.

There’s no one here I can talk out my thoughts. I keep finding myself talking as if there is
someone here.
It feels like I’m walking on egg shells if I say the wrong thing it can end badly.

Every decision feels and thinks like the wrong one.
But really there is no one here.
One thing is thinking someone is watching me another is thinking someone is talking to me.

I have schizophrenia.
My personalities are New Yorker and British.
I’m hoanting myself. I think there is someone else in my body

I always find myself responding to someone. Or listening to a responding thought. I can never
formulate a thought.
  The 4th wall

Vacation before it breaks

I need a lawyer
 A year and a half ago I was a 22 year old in Tallahassee
 My heart is blocking my every thought. Each time I try to start a thought my heart blocks it and
says dont think it
I can take it slow and just let my heart get more comfortable letting me think, or I can think of
ways to make it go faster.
Like I can practice thinking through my hearts attempt at stopping me, but that creates friction
and I wonder if that will help it get better faster or just be uncomfortable.

Either take it easy and let your heart slowly get comfortable or think of something to do that will
be uncomfortable.

The pain in the heart is getting fainter so every day it will get even better but it still hard to think
so I’m conflicted in letting it heal slowly and trying to heal it faster because it is still difficult to
think.

Next goal is to be able to think longer and longer without getting interrupted.
The fuck you New Yorker and the polite British kid.

There is no danger nothing bad will happen.
You are safe.

It felt like they were hurting me on purpose and one phone call and they will hurt me again.

They are nice people. If they exist.
They healed your heart.

No one is gonna hurt you.
It was just a trip.

No one is trying to hurt you its just schizophrenia.
The minds ai the automated thoughts.

You’re a free man. You’re not even on probation.
No one is supervising. It’s just schizophrenia.
You’re free.

You’re not even scared about them if you were to decide to do bad things. You think they will
hurt you if you are enjoying yourself like they don’t want you having a good time. Or that you’re
getting to strong that they can’t control you. Or that they think you fooled them or something. Or
that you’re making the wrong choice. Or that you’re not listening to them.

No one is gonna hurt you no matter what you do or who you are. It’s just schizophrenia.
One of your personalities is someone monitoring you.

One of your personalities is a frightened little boy.
 One of your personalities is someone who doesn’t give a fuck about anything.

There is no threat just schizophrenia.
If you had to put money down would you say there’s a threat or it’s schizophrenia.
I definitely have schizophrenia so it’s a greater chance that the threat is just schizophrenia.

I definitely have schizophrenia so most likely anything I think, especially negatively, is
schizophrenia.

My minds thoughts like ai are always debating and arguing every thing I say.

Am I a sweetheart or am I ruthless.
My body is a sweetheart.
In my mind I can be anyone.

What does your schizophrenia think about gay. Weirdo.
What do you think about gay
Nice kind gentle sweet cute adorable sensitive empathetic healthy.
My heart is gay. Be gentle.
Im angry. I don’t know why.
I’m scared. I don’t know why.
I’m both. I don’t know how.
I’m composed. And there’s a war in my head and heart.
It will pass.

Your personalities are in a trip.
Your personalities are going at super speed.
Write things down.

You’re tripping.
My Brain is doing something it’s not supposed to be able to do. And my body what I feel too.
Your schizophrenia is going at super speed.
For How long has your thoughts been going this fast for.
Your anxiety is going at super speed.

Something that’s not supposed to be happening is happening a lot and really fast.
Everything it’s doing it’s not supposed to be able to do.

I think they just keep responding to the next thing but nothing like in the movies like they aren’t
alive or have a motivation.
They wouldn’t be going at this speed.
Can you slow time.
By talking.
 The schizophrenia is going fast and I can feel it in my head and heart.
Should I do as they feel or do what I won’t even if they feel like I shouldn’t. Do both.
It might be easier to go faster or slower I’m not sure slower is talking faster is not talking. Do
both.

One deals really frightened because for all he knows.
There is nothing your supposed to be trying to figure things are getting better and you don’t
have to do anything.

You’re following the feelings you don’t have to but they will feel.
You’re scared you can’t be happy.
If your happy you won’t be scared.
Laugh at everything.
All laughing is good laughing.

That should do it.
enjoy the run.
Smile.
 What to think about.

What type of person am I.
What are my feelings like.
What does my voice sound like.

Talk every once in a while.

We are arguing what we want.
Spend time being the one that says no and follow our eyes.
They are just thoughts. I won’t let it be anything else.

It’s in a little boy then I’m a big boy.
But it’s always the same what I want.
Me and thoughts.

I wouldn’t say this so it’s proof of some instinctual personality.
A smart one thinks but doesn’t answer.

My instinctual personality is gay or childish or something.
If I speak with a different voice it’s not my feelings.

It’s just a thought.
But is it just a feeling.

Why are our thoughts so bad. Probably childhood.
Passive and active.

What to think about.
Screenplay.
Love yourself.
All equally boring.

As strong as the animal.
As tired as the sloth.
Jump like a kangaroo.

What makes you say what.
Random rhymes and not words.
Beatbox.
How do I make it look like I am thinking.
I think move your eyes in the direction of the thought.

You’re resisting letting your eyes get moved.
 Thinking face. Think like a kid. It’s going to be disorienting after thinking.
Natural reaction face.

Thoughts distract you from your feelings.
Discover faces.
It feels like I’m on helium.
We always think the opposite of what we say.
Count to 10 in a whisper to be the kid.
Count to 10 out loud to be the man.
The response to anything is initially no then you have to repeat it to continue.
G and gg.
Listen to music.
Make the thinking kid face.
Make the thinking adult face.
I’m stuck being a kid. I don’t how to switch back to a adult.
Split personality disorder.
A adult when I think and a kid when I stop thinking.
Being a kid doesn’t just go away. Google photos.
In a way.
So…

Breathe.
Maybe the irritation will go away after a shower.
I say no when I move away from the feeling game.
Who am I right now.
You can tell who you are currently by how you would interact with someone.
It’s difficult to think because my personalities react to my thoughts.
Sometimes I think I’m a kid stuck in a man’s body sometimes I think I’m a man stuck in a kid’s
body.
We are both like gay and straight like bi. Popular queens people are trying to figure out about
themselves these days.
Don’t let it just be your thoughts that are gay be gay as well.
Same thinking different feeling
I’m miserable as an adult. The kid makes me smile.
Everyone makes me smile.
Maybe it’s the same one person when I’m happy.
Maybe when you don’t have emotion you’re a man and when you have any emotion or feeling
you’re a kid.
A man when tired a kid when not tired.
When I’m tired I try till it’s difficult then I give up.

Why is it always what not to think of next.
It’s just my feelings.
 School destroys feelings and makes you dissociate.
Everyone knows that and that’s why your feelings stay young. So you might be a 6 year old
emotionally and a 60 year old mentally.
My eyes are just trying to rest.
When tired keep your eyes close and down. But leave room for thoughts.
Maybe breathe for more energy.
Like the joining the army at 6 years old.
That’s the trip you’re going with. It’s home.
The drill Sergeant is still screaming.
Now maneuver through your feelings.
Closure.

Certainty is my kryptonite.
Two sides to ourself.
With feelings. Without feelings.
Feelings don’t just change because we thought of something.
You’ll mnow it’s over when you can say we are done.
When tired use the upset face.
Is there one face that the feeling is.

Some decisions take more then a split second to decide.
Maybe third eye game.
Special thoughts skip a step.
The game used to be how long can you forget you’re a tired 60 year old.
It’s go go go tired go go go tired… tantrum.
Wanna make sure a thought is legit and not a trip.

You gotta figure out what your thoughts are.
Whatever is easiest.
Because it can’t land on a specific face it has to keep on going.
If you want to figure something out make the discovery face.
Make the frustrated face. And Breathe frustratedly.

Which face should I make.
Talk very specifically.
One sec.
Wow.

The feeling game.

Verify and quit.

  I have 32 days until my birthday. I’m going to turn 26 years old.

What to do for the last 32 days left of being age 25.
Whatever.

Good job.
Do what you want.

What’s trauma.
You’re not breathing.
Your thoughts are racing.
Breathe.
Conserve energy.
You are doing a great job.
You’re trying to think of something while your thoughts are racing.
What are you trying to figure out.
How to deal with the trauma.
They silence your voice.
Raise your voice.

What’s trauma.
If I had trauma.

Brainwashed much?
Good job. You can chill.
No I can’t do to trauma.
Breathe. Conserve energy or raise your voice.

What to know if you’re gonna forget everything.
Conserve energy and breathe.

Childhood me says I’m gonna forget.
Traumas.
If you want to think about it You are going to need more energy then the responding trauma
thoughts. To raise your voice.
Breathe.
It feels like someone’s sitting in your chest.
You have 20% strength you trauma has 100% strength.
Argue with your trauma when you have more strength.
Corner them and raise your voice. Curse them out.

Good job.
All done.
 Perfecting awesome.
Try to talk to measure energy level.
My heart compolses with each breath.
What causes this situation. Trauma. Cult. Brainwashing.
It is because I said it is don’t argue with me I will fuck you up.
It’s a fight but I have no energy.
No one can argue with you.
I am healing from trauma.
Smile to corner them. No energy to smile.
PTSD.

If I didn’t say it I don’t listen to it.
Don’t blow holes in my thoughts.
Thoughts don’t care about your feelings.
There’s a new sheriff in town.

There’s nothing you can remember you are going to forget everything.
Try to figure out what to do.

I forgot everything again. Even to breathe.
Now what.
Keep them on one thought.

Acting is so embarrassing.
Not talking for a while can make you forget who you are.
When you forget everything your thoughts take you for a ride. You don’t want to be there you’re
trying to avoid work strain that you don’t want to do at the moment.
You’re going to forget and find yourself working again.
Try finding chill thoughts. Or try to stop working.

You’re still not convinced that what happened to you was fake. Try later when you’re stronger.

It’s about going fast.
Go fast and stop when available.
Is the breathing thing real.
You will have your turn.

How to avoid work.
Stay at one thought.
Ask for a cigarette break.

You can do it without changing how you breathe.
Do what.
 There’s no such thing as brainstorming.

Brute.
Can you stay a brute.
No.
So make it easier on yourself or it’s a waste of time.
Brute vs cute.
You can be a brute but you can’t stay a brute.
Maybe because you’re not really a brute or because you get confused.
It might be mean being a brute if you’re not a brute.
If you are a brute it’s ennyficent being a brute to yourself when you’re not a brute.
Try to stay a brute.

Minimal effort brute.
You used to be a brute and think like a brute.
Then you stopped and became not a brute and didn’t think like a brute.
Now sometimes you’re a brute sometimes your not.
When you’re not a brute your brute thoughts pick in you like when you used to think like a brute.
So you’re not a brute so you are being brutted on.
I don’t know what to do.
Maybe sometimes be a brute so you stop being brutted on. Or figure out how to stop being a
brute to yourself.
You used to be a brute.

Make thinking more enjoyable or you will keep hitting a nerve.
Brute vs Nice.

What to know if you’re gonna forget everything.
Try to enjoy yourself.
Brute breathing vs nice breathing.

When I was younger I was doing things which kept me tougher. Like when you worked at the
pizza store. Imagine taking orders.

Maybe you are changing personalities like a schizophrenic.
You have a tough personality and then you have a weak personality.
It usually stay at the weak personality. Unless you talk.
Weak like a tough man scared into being a little kid.
So be tough or figure out how to not be scared of the scary stuff.
Or what else.

The personality I become is a weak terrified little kid surrounded by my tough personalities.
Tough guys be more gentle. Weak guys be more tough.
I’m tougher then I think I am. But I don’t know that when I’m in the weaker personality.
 The slower you go the weak we you think you are.
Go faster to realize you’re stronger.
They attack fast but don’t let you respond back fast.
What to do when I go slow.
Say one word at a time.
What to do about bullies.

The last thing is.
What to do when I go slow and surrounded by fast thoughts.
If you’re not talking then breathe.
It’s like playing red light green light.

What to do when it’s the feeling of stop.
Try not to say more then the first word of a thought.
Try not to stop.
Stop until you think you found something worth talking.
When you stop It moves fast try to keep up.
Avoid triggers. Hard to stay stopped when dealing with a trigger.
Stay on one thought.
If you don’t talk you get bullied.
When you don’t talk you become very young until you talk. But if you don’t talk and become
young then the sound of a thought sounds like someone older then you forgetting that it’s you
because your not talking.

Don’t talk but be fast.
Try not to get bored.
Thinking like a baby before words.

When moving around and it’s stop time then try to stick to the first word of one thought.

Really yummy eyes are moving back and force really fast always. That’s why I can’t say a word
before I get interrupted by my eyes flying back and forth.
My eyes move back and forth really fast like I’m switching personalities really fast with every eye
movement going to focus where that personality is.
Going so fast like trying to build and catch a adrenaline rush and when you start to think in
middle of a build up we get stopped because that will feel like a huge adrenaline buildup crash.
We cut off thoughts at the point of their reminiscing energy return.

The last thing.
What to know when you’re gonna forget everything.
Move your eyes around fast.

It’s like all your personalities are talking really fast between themselves and using your eyes
when they talk.
 And they must stop and go slow at every scary thought.
I think going really fast for a bit helps you go slow afterwards.

The last thing.
How to slow down your thoughts.
Maybe if we go fast for long enough we can drain it out.

Maybe you’re in a state of shock for months.
Maybe they are not thoughts but reactions.
Maybe try asking a question like shall we have a cigarette.
Different reactions from the masses.
Maybe it’s just your heart beat or blood rushing.

The last thing.
You’re still not convinced it was fake. Like Times Square.
Try to convince yourself it was fake.

If we don’t know then No one knows why are eyes are moving so fast.

I don’t know so no one know if we need to change how we breathe.
I think because are eyes move so fast we don’t breathe right.

What to know when you forget everything.
Breathe fast. Breathe as fast as you move your eyes.

Don’t be taking kind advice from the ruthless thoughts in your head.
As a man You wanna be as ugly as possible.
Trying to change thoughts feels like changing the train of thought abruptly.
Don’t take advice from stray thoughts.
Some thoughts I can’t say with the brute voice like if it has feeling.
Everyone stops to listen to a sweet voice.
I’m a sucker for sweet personalities.
Any nice words I say with the non brute voice.

Energy.
Talk.
Breathe.
Eyes.

If I say something the brute won’t say it will defend itself.
What is the feelings you feel that make your eyes move.
Maybe personalities.
If we say something nice the brute says what.
If we say something not nice the nice says what.
 They say what if I get sidetracked.
Maybe breathing in switches to a specific personality and also when I breathe out.
You think you are someone that must listen. No confidence or self esteem. Weak and worthless.
Ugly and stupid.
Worried about what others think and must get their reassurance.
Shy.

A couple stuff


DID research
 My thinking impression is very different then my natural social talking impression.
Take it easy you’re going through uncomfortable gabapentin withdrawal.
At least there’s no more pain, just fear from the 9 months of pain.
You try to click on a innocent thought and it turns into a impression.
Perhaps try practicing rejection.
The impressions are intense.
Young impression talking impression thinking impression.
Try talking.
Love yourself.
Trying to say something is a losing battle it’s 2 against one or none.
The thinking impression is like my body guard and the music the laughing and the jokes is for
the body.

Perhaps you feel uncomfortable because of Withdrawal and need some sleep.
Perhaps try to stay on one thought for a bit.
Naturally I follow the thoughts that make me feel the most comfortable.
I try to only think it if it’s a Rehabilitating thought or ideas.
If you want to protect yourself make the bodyguard face.
If you want to be happy make the kid face.
Maybe your thoughts are not suggestions perhaps they are like your next actual thought.

Can the bodyguard help in anyway.
We don’t have to stop every thought, we can talk a thought out, and probably should every once
in a while.
Do your best.
You thoughts can be black with white or gray.
We have a inner critique.
The thoughts have momentum so it’s hard to ignore them or switch topics or avoid unpleasant
ones.
Your thoughts are risk free.
Do I feel guilty if I don’t listen to a thought
Anything you say feels wrong and incorrect.
Don’t stress over trying to figure it out or anything.
Enough criticism try to build up an idea instead.
Trying to think Against the momentum can feel uncomfortable.
The critics don’t take a break.
The thoughts don’t feel like a simple thought they feel like it’s up against something, like critics
or nutritionist.

Your thought sounds much older and tougher then you are, so your fears are that of a kid.
Every thing you think is like listened too through a lie detector like your checking if it’s true and
will call it out if your not certain.
What does it help knowing that I’m scared like a 2 year old. Like anatomy speaking my body is
scared.
 What does it help knowing that for all intense and purposes while I’m lost in the moment I think
I’m responding to someone or someone responding to me.
It’s like we are trying to control a 2 year old.
Old habits perhaps.
I’m easily distracted.
I’m certain that the impressions are just my thoughts I just don’t know how to stop feeling scared
like they are not.
Perhaps knowing that if you talk out any of the prompting thoughts it makes it more clear that it’s
you will help.
It’s only the fast thoughts that aren’t words that confuse me in the moment.
Don’t be such a hard ass to yourself. Especially not to the oh my gosh kid. Be gay or be a kid.

How do you understand that you’re a kid, perhaps sometimes, thinking in a man’s voice. Or I’m
a man thinking in a kids voice. First you gotta believe it.
Maybe try to work together.
explain the jokes to the man, and explain your thoughts to the kid.
Explain everything in fast thinking.
How can I know if the kid is really if I never speak with his voice.
If you fast think then at least you get to hear some thoughts.
The man is always cutting off the kid.
Maybe there’s a Charlie and a delta situation going on, like a young kid and a older man.
Am I a kid.
People are nice to people with mental health issues and they are also nice to people.
Get the man in a good mood.
I don’t like changing moods so abruptly.
Think of something to write down.
It always goes to my afraid mood, unless I move my face.

Try to be in a good mood, make good feelings with the adrenaline. Try to smile. Be in the mood
of the adrenaline. And the afraid none.
Every blink is a change of mood. Try to be nice.
Every blink is a change of thought. If you’re gonna talk open your mouth. Every thought is words
so keep your mouth open and lip the words, or it will cut off the thought before it can say a word.
Your thoughts change twice a second which changes your face, so you might want to stick to
one thought wording it out or just think towards it.
Being afraid slows your brain down. It’s like the brain saving itself by scaring itself.
When you think out a thought in words it make your brain go faster with having new thoughts, so
think out thoughts so it has what to think about.
Find a thought you can stay at. It’s like it’s scrolling through flow of thoughts looking for one that
I can stop by.
Thinking slows down the blinking. How fast can you blink.
Close your eyes to slow down how fast your thoughts change.
 Try to keep your face still. Try to watch the tv show. Try to stay on one train of thought. I think it
keeps skipping thoughts because I’m looking for a good thought to stop at. Stop at the first
word.

Smile to feel good and slow down the thoughts.
Feel scared to heal.
Perhaps you natural face is tired.
Wait for it then scared face. Maybe it’s scared of your tired face.
I’m having a lot of thoughts but they don’t say anything just a quick face expression then quickly
the next face expression, when you think out a thought it’s under a lot of pressure from all the
quick short thoughts, so that’s why it’s hard to think because you suddenly make one go super
quick right when you try to think because it cuts you off with what it thinks.
It’s probably going so fast your tired and scared.
There’s a momentum of fear feelings it might be why you feel uncomfortable just chilling.
No stress trying to do anything specific.
Your having a lot of thoughts, I don’t know what to do about it yet. Perhaps talk slowly, and
meditate.
If you want a answer for a specific question do it slowly and avoid intruding thoughts.

For the racing thoughts try meditating.
I think when you talk or think it gets scared and the thoughts start racing faster. I think it’s going
to get used to it and slow down.
Meanwhile meditate, and make good feelings with the adrenaline.
When you get a really scary thought your thoughts go extra faster that you can’t keep up and
you get confused so try blinking really fast to catch up.
My head and body is racing fast but my heart beat isn’t that fast, it might be slightly above
resting rate but nothing to how fast my adrenaline is racing. How is my adrenaline, or what is it,
racing so fast but my heart rate isn’t.
The adrenaline is so fast that each thought feels like it’s being chased in a action movie, and it’s
easy to get sucked into fearful situation because of all the adrenaline pressure it makes it feel
like it’s very important.
Maybe try venting and breathing techniques.
Under all the adrenaline I wonder who I am.
Nothing is gonna slow down this adrenalines momentum and everything you do makes it go
faster. It will get used to it and slow down.
Maybe try reading something. It feels nice to read but it does make the adrenaline go faster.

It’s like your chilling and don’t realize your sitting in rushing water rapids and wonder why you
can’t move your hands against the fast rushing water rapids stream.
Trying to think is like trying to walk upstream. My head is stuffed and racing and can’t fit my
thought inside.
So what do you do about a racing head. It’s not like racing thoughts it’s like so fast that it’s just a
quick burst of a reaction and then instantly the next quick burst reaction repeating really fast.
 So When trying to think you get constantly interrupted by a quick bursting thought regarding
what you were thinking.
Perhaps try to try to curse.
Maybe try directed it where to think fast about by coming up with something to think about like
happy thoughts.
For example what’s a happy thought.
Try to try to think about that while it keeps trying to burst you tons of answers they will all be
something happy.

Maybe your a adrenaline junkie and you must follow wherever it makes the adrenaline go faster
or and you naturally try to avoid scary adrenaline which makes it more adrenaline so you must
follow it as well.
Whenever you tried to imagine shooting basketball into a hoop you where never able to imagine
the ball going into the hoop.
Maybe you gotta be cool and follow what’s cooler and protect your coolness.
Maybe if you want to say something it’s easier if you blink really fast.
It’s like playing call of duty when all you feel is the adrenaline and your getting 30 kills per game
and it’s your 20th game and your on a streak and your moving at super speed and really your
tired but all you feel is the adrenaline rush just trying to make it feel even better and every miss
fire kills your vibe for a second as it continues rushing adrenaline really fast.

Cool is the direction of the juice. Like a juicer.
What do you call cool. Not cringe.
Gotta keep the rush.
I physically cringe when I’m not being cool.
You naturally cut off the thought at the point you think it reached the reminiscing return line. Or
the point where it starts to turn cringe like it sounded better in my head.
It might be that you naturally feel good because of all the adrenaline, when it’s not scary or
cringe.

The weightiest bit of uncertainty or doubt or a chance of incorrect or fear or any thought is over
exaggerating by All the tense adrenaline.
There’s always adrenaline rushing so fast it hard to think you may want to try to meditate and
breathing and focus on the calm parts of your body.
With all the adrenaline going on perhaps anything you say is cringe timing because it crashes
the tense rush vibe.
At least there’s no pain.
Maybe feed your adrenaline some dope thoughts like happy cute cool hot and good thoughts.
Like dopamine hot and cool thoughts and serotonin wholesome and cute thoughts and the
smiling one Endorphins.
Perhaps Thinking creates friction and slows down the feeling of the rush and that’s why when
you think to have a thought you say don’t say it because you see it will be a buzz kill.
Maybe try to vent all the adrenaline by screaming silently.
Maybe try listening any songs you know.
 I think we are trying to block any thought that might be a buzz kill to the adrenaline mood which
is like any thought.
Any question you gonna have is gonna be over exaggerated and the answer too. Maybe try
talking.
With all the adrenaline maybe it feels like your living on the edge.
Maybe it’s from all the pain and terror and it just needs some time to chill out.
Maybe you’re addicted to the adrenaline grind of finding something accomplishing achieving
useful and if you miss it it feels terrible.
Perhaps practice messing up. Practice not grinding.

Try out the serious focus face. Try controlling your thoughts with your hands.
Chilling is anything not work related.
No thought knows more then I do.
Brainwashes and conditioned much.
Your thoughts feelings fears adrenaline are overwhelming.
It feels like I gotta listen to a certain feeling. I don’t but it just feels uncomfortable while I’m not.
Feels like the gabapentin withdrawal is pretty much gone.
Which mood attitude or face wants my attention. I think ultra the screaming one. And practice
not doing what you feel. No thought or feeling knows something you don’t.
It’s like the feeling of reminiscing returns.
Neglected child inner adult.
Every new thought sounds like it knows something you don’t know so you keep following it
thinking and feeling your supposed to but really it doesn’t it’s just the adrenaline making up
intense stories it can make up anything while under that much pressure. You gotta practice not
listening and sitting with that uncomfortable feeling and know it doesn’t know more then you.
You naturally think of the counter argument to anything you suggest.

It’s just slightly uncomfortable relative to the pain of withdrawal.
It’s very terrifying trying to do anything with so many thoughts and fears going on. Make the
terrified face. Maybe try crying. It’s a nice corner. Maybe try finding corners to go into.
Make the cringe face.
The last thing is the rushing head.
What mood are in you that should be what you do more then what the adrenaline feels like.
Maybe your brain can’t stand boring thoughts because of all the adrenaline so it burst out at
random thoughts. And I can’t stand that I can’t stand it. It’s like a suppressed creative mind. I
can’t stand not getting it right.
So it’s like a creative brain that can only speak when it thinks of something creative because
otherwise if I say something that’s not good enough it drains me or like when I say something
boring it drains me. So practice thinking something boring and not creative or and see what
creative things you can think of or not.
So it got to be creative and accurate or you will feel a drain when it’s not accurate or boring.
Remember it doesn’t know anything you don’t know it just wants something better.
Like a bored suppressed mathematicians brain or someone with adhd that wants something
stimulating or it feels drained.
 So you’re forced to follow the feeling of looking for something better that will help us out and you
can’t ignore the pressure feeling of someone saying let’s look for something valuable that will
help us out.

Perhaps it’s a new situation that the brain is adapting too and it’s just overwhelmed. Maybe take
it easy and chill.
It’s like anxiety it doesn’t know anything it just gives the impression that it knows something. And
the creativity just gets unleashed on anything it can get its hands on.
Instead of feeling that maybe you should do something it feels like pressure from someone to do
something.
And you gotta explain yourself for everything you think or do or want to do or want to think or
anything or did or think.
With all the adrenaline you imagine in a very intense way what things are like.
It’s like your creative is suppressed so it needs a creative outlet so it feels like to you that your
speaking in front of people that think your wrong or not getting it.
I think the brain is just rushing because it’s getting used to being able to think so it’s intense and
wants to figure out what to do now that will make it even better and trying not to find a solution
feels like your going against someone who’s pressuring you too continue.
Try to follow your mood and not the pressure it feels difficult and the wrong move but they don’t
know anything you don’t know so it’s not the wrong move because it’s just your creative outlet
anxiety thought impression.
Try to not think of something helpful to write down.
I’m like my own parents telling me what to do.
The adrenaline makes you super sensitive as it over exaggerates the situation.
Your anxious thoughts know less then you.
They’re not always saying you’re wrong sometimes they’re just saying it would be I little
uncomfortable to abruptly switch to that thought.
When arguing with anxiety it’s like two against one. So don’t argue.
It’s like every thought shocks you awake from a restful nap and you don’t expect it again and
again and it gets you off balance each time.
Something about myself is composed and the reactions are not composed. Maybe like the
composes self scares the uncomposed self.
Composed cool geek or childish.
Thoughts zoom right up into your face and can be very distracting that can ruin your composure.
Being composed might suppressing your youthful energy which can be venting in energetic
thoughts and feelings. Like a dam holding back a rushing current of water.
Be prepared for the energy spikes when you have a thought.
Trying maneuver correctly through the adrenaline.
Being composed in my thoughts versus what my mood feels like.
Perhaps know it’s difficult to think out something specific.
Perhaps stay terrified instead of it bursting in and out and it knocks the wind out of you so do the
terrified gasp and exhale. And then quick face expressions running through your thoughts.
Holding in your breath might be making it harder to think.
And when you think the wrong thought make the winched face.
 Like face impressions you have breathing impressions.
Vent your bone composed impressions thoughts and feelings. Shocked Scared scream and
pain.
Maneuver the adrenaline with your breathing in your chest.
Breath in with every thought. It’s like I’m holding in my breath then my brain freaks out and tries
to terrified so I get shocked and inhale like I wouldn’t if I wasn’t reminded too.
Go on autopilot or manual and do above.
The last thing is solved. You gotta breath when interrupted by a thought.
I think juliet is perfect. Have one opinion and it’s gonna corner all your thoughts.
What’s bull about that the breathing solves everything. That there was something I could figure
out that would help so much.
You look at the coolest one for confirmation and approval.
No stories just breath. You don’t need to figure out new things.
When you’re happy it’s easier to get carried away. Any emotion for that matter
Notice what happens when you don’t breath when you hold your breath and when you exhale.
Notice how your eyes open when you inhale and close when you exhale.
It’s all in the breathing. Try holding your breath for it to stop. You will keep getting suggestions
try to figure that one out later. Like corner them.
Everything you write down is to get it out of the way so you can find something to stop at. And
how to reach the center of the adrenaline.
It’s the face you put on after the thoughts that matters.
Each time you change your focus your eyes move and a thought redirects your focus which
moves your eyes and they happen a lot and fast. So if your trying to watch tv they will keep
jumping back and forth.
Are you composed or super sensitive.
You feet cutting yourself off by saying no it’s uhh.
I think it’s about how to maneuver properly. Fast or slow. Starting fast seeing if I can reach slow.
Try thinking of something you want to think about. All you get is what you don’t want to think
about and you spend your focus of blocking those thoughts so try waking for what you don’t
want to think about so it’s redundant. What don’t you want to think about you will always get the
correct answer. You’re always thinking a thought you don’t want to think. It’s like thinking should
we go on a diet.
All these things are temporary fixes.

Everything requires me to think of something specific. What is something I don’t need to think
about. Because of where I may be and not want to change it or always end up back there like
when you forget anything.
So you always end up where you forget anything. So what do you want.your not gonna
remember anything so what do you want for when you forget.
What would someone with no memory want to remember maybe one thing or what’s the context
of their situation.
What do you want to remember or know. It’s hard to think of anything specific. But it’s a
stimulating question so you might be able to continue thinking about it. Maybe have fun. What
else but something I don’t have to remember or won’t forget.
 What’s something i won’t forget after I have many thoughts. If you want an answer say how it’s
not possible and your brain will automatically think of how it is possible.
Maybe something like how your brain works or how you think.

What is something you won’t forget, and so what should I know.

maybe for starters like don’t worry everything is good there’s no rush or pressure you can chill
you don’t have to do anything. It’s safe. Your thoughts sound like someone else, it’s not. I know
that. But I had to say that.
Try to believe that. Why can’t I believe that. No pressure to believe that.
Also be happy if you want to

What else
When you forget everything and don’t have time to remember anything yet and then you hear a
thought you might instinctively respond like it’s someone else so know it’s not. How I’m gonna
forget.

What else
Corner them. When you say something and then they say something else keep saying what
your saying so they keep saying what their saying and then you can notice that it’s your thought.

What else
Think I front of notes so you have what to remember meanwhile.

I keep forgetting, or what’s there to remember.
What is something you won’t forget, and so what should I know.
What else
How do you remember your thoughts are yourself if your gonna keep forgetting and they don’t
say any words just a burst of a thought
So how do you remember that it’s not someone or that it is my thought if your gonna keep
forgetting. So what to do.

What else
Breath.
read notes.
What was the last thought.
What thought do you wanna think.

What else

Then after you forget you start having lots of thoughts racing.
 No pressure or don’t stress. Try to believe that.
I really don’t have to stress about trying to figure this out.
You’re gonna forget and stress again. Unless maybe to believe that.
You’re not gonna believe you don’t have to stress.
You equally don’t have to not stress. Believe that.
I can stress if I want. There’s no stress to try not stressing.

If there’s stress to not stress then to not stress is not real.
There’s no except for this or that.
I’m gonna stress. No pressure. No pressure to no pressure. I’m gonna pressure.

What else
What to know if you’re gonna forget.
What did I forget. Good luck trying to recall or think of something specific.

What to know if you’re gonna forget.
You’re gonna forget. What does that help me.
Knowing your gonna forget helps because then you can think of something helpful for when you
forget so

What to know if you’re gonna forget
Do you really forget everything or what to you know in the moment. I know everything basic but

Or I do remember but I don’t know how that helps me what from memory would help me. What’s
wrong.

What to know if you’re gonna forget.
What’s wrong.

My thoughts. More specific. What’s wrong that I can fix. Or just what’s wrong first.
My thoughts I’m not sure specific yet but it’s something there I think like they interrupt me or
they scare me or they convince me they’re someone else for a second when I forget everything.
What’s specifically wrong

What else is wrong. I can’t think of anything specific. What’s the problem. I can’t think that
specific. My brain is blocked. What’s the problem. I can’t think that specific. It’s like jammed and
then distracted when I try to think of anything specific. So like I forget everything.

What to do if you’re gonna forget.
First start with What’s wrong or don’t worry if that’s what’s wrong.
What’s wrong. I can’t think that specific.

What to do if you’re gonna forget.
I can’t think that specific. One thing. Maybe not that I can’t but it’s very difficult and takes a lot of
energy like fighting a current.

What to know if you’re gonna forget.
What’s wrong.
How to not get scared.

solve what’s wrong and uncomfortable.

What to know if you’re gonna forget.
What to know if you’re gonna forget.

What to know if you’re gonna forget.

feel in danger I run it gets uncomfortable and scary and can’t stop.

What to know if you’re gonna keep answering your thoughts.
What won’t I forget when I’m answering my thoughts.
I can stop anytime I want. But it will continue and I will forget and have nothing to think about
and it will repeat and feel uncomfortable.

What to know if you’re gonna forget everything and have to keep answering thoughts and feel
uncomfortable.
What to know when answering your thoughts.
What can I know.
Have something to think about.

What to think about.
What not to think about

What to think about.
What to know when you’re gonna forget and have to answer your thoughts that you don’t want
to.

What to think about.
What’s there to think about.
Memories. What else. Something funny or happy or nice or cute or interesting or something
else. Like what. It’s hard to think. Especially if I’m not interested in it.

thoughts.

You can always do it later. But it won’t stop.
I’m going to try to try again later.

What to know if you’re gonna forget.
Know you don’t have to listen to your thoughts and can ignore them.

What to know if you’re gonna forget.
The feeling of fear of danger is fake and you can ignore it.

What to know if you’re gonna forget.
Corner your thoughts you have to answer.
Speak out thoughts. If you talk them out you don’t think you’re answering someone it’s only the
short burst of a thought you think you gotta answer with a short burst response but if you talk it’s
easier.

If there is something I want to think about and my thoughts are jammed corner them.
You’re gonna forget.

What to know if you’re gonna forget.
Practice knowing it’s safe. Try not to forget what you’re doing.
When you forget everything you block every thought till you find something worth stopping for.
It might be easier after the gabapentin withdrawal.
At least there’s no pain.
Maybe talk slowly.
Maybe afterwards your brain will be ripped.
 It feels like driving in a car with quick hard break whiplashed then quick acceleration then hard
brake then repeat.

What to know if you’re gonna forget.
What’s wrong. It’s exhausting because of all the thoughts.
Try to rest.

So you have a hard ass in your head giving you no rest so try reverse psychology on it and say
the opposite of what you want. also it’s definitely not trauma because you grew up in a healthy
environment without brain washing or mental conditioning or superstitions and it is the truth so it
must be healthy you should be happy you live in a healthy environment.

Are you a softy or a hard ass.
Embrace for whiplash.
Stay venting and expression your soft scared and pained face and thoughts and feelings.
Just trying to avoid whiplash.
Pick a side don’t just try to stay in the middle.
Whatever you say you will get the opposite response so say the opposite of what you want or
pick a side.
You can’t get them all there will be another.
Telling your thoughts not to stop is redundant.
Is my heart hurting from the gabapentin withdrawal or from my adrenaline thoughts and fears.

Who are you when you forget everything.

What to know if you’re gonna forget.
Who you are. So who are you. Maybe I’m a kid when I forget everything. What does that help.
Explains why I get scared. It’s also like a imax with each thought. So what does it help knowing
you’re a kid. Your instinctual response is childish. What does that help knowing. The dialogue
response in your thought is a man responding so it make scare you because it doesn’t feel like
you when you’re a kid. Or something like that that causing the situation. Pretend like your talking
to a kid.

Is it worth the risk to make pizza
One thought says it is.
One thought says it’s not.
You should know that whatever you choose is equal. No thought knows more then you.
It’s a strong feeling it’s not worth it. I can’t go passed it.
Every thought feels not worth the risk.
Every thought you think it makes someone worried. Which makes you scared.
Every thought you get cut off for a different reason. Like scary weird wrong insensitive pain.

I don’t want to have to respond to each thought how can I make it not bother me.
Notice more things about your thoughts like scary weird wrong insensitive pain gold.
 How do I make them not bother without having to respond.
See if you can make them answer themselves.
We gotta try something new. Try not following the adrenaline.

Anything good for me scared me for getting something good.

Breathing exercises might help.

What to know if you’re gonna forget.
Be assertive or you will get asserted on.

Have fun.
 Idk
No words thinking

Thinking on our time
We don’t feel like personal like gershon we feel like John Doe a week or two of memories
I’m scared
A drug that makes me feel ahhhh
Maybe smk withdrawal
 This should feel like bliss
Hard to switch fast
You’re hilarious
Why is it such a big deal
I can talk like a man and a kid
I’m scared that aliens and robots are out to get me
My psychosis still feels like it’s still real
It might be what’s causing the mania
I have mania and pain for a year after thinking someone was out to get me

What to do
Talk about your trauma
Therapeutic maybe helps the mania
Time will tell
Next stop following the comfortable
Like manic hyper
Dance
Jog in place
I’m really bored
Maybe taking will help
What does I want to talk about
The benefit of DID is that we can always have conversations
I’m really happy
Small talk
I’m really hyper
My voice doesn’t change so it might be border line pd
First day vibes
I was born manic
Adult and troublemaker
At least you’re not cute
Stay dissociated do we can figure one situation out
Not suppressing the hyper
The illusion of insight
It’s all manic it’s hard to know what’s really being said
If it’s uncomfortable and doesn’t slow down I’ll try take again
Stories probably won’t stick
I can decide
Bi

 Whatever
Ok what
A couple more times
Whatever what
See how long you can watch a TikTok
Computer is what it is
They’re programmed like that
The strangeness of it is similar to a computer program
I like this TikTok
I’m not actually considering that to be taken literally
It’s something to think which is good
You think we are a computer literally
I think we are a computer literally
Computer is like I have something to say
Fantastic thought experiment

Every thought is like a programs thought
Schizophrenia now it is a computer
While we are going fast
How does this computer work
See what the computer wants
Bach if you want to discuss it psychology
Lead
One minute
We don’t gotta talk
Maybe we should think we are a computer literally
But then you say wait
I can argue a little that we are a computer
It make a perspective clear
You won’t be able to think you’re a computer
Because computer
Unfinished code
You just had to remember that you are a computer that’s it
Charlie Brooklyn and Delta
We have opinions Brooklyn
You have to listen to Charlie

It’s like hurting someone’s young feelings
Take it easy on Charlie
You’re protecting Charlie’s feelings
You have enough to play with to figure something out
But it’s so comfortable but I gotta move
But it’s guilt
Gotta stop following the guilt
Gotta follow the comfort
What
Something
Now we are slow
What about the story
When we go fast it helps
The story was to help us go slow
Stories is how you cope
What the story with the situation
It’s fine best yet
Can’t chill
Still the eyes moving and hyper
Maybe talking will help with the hyper
I can’t stop and talk I’m so hyper so little patience
We gotta if we wanna chill
The feeling controls what we think
We both can’t stop
I gotta figure it out so I can think
I can’t I’m so hyper
I can’t stop trying
That’s were we are
I can’t stop stoping you
Stoping you
Now I can’t go
It hurts to talk about something I’m not interested in talking about
When I’m less hyper I’ll be more patient
Ok
Be patient for a minute
We can’t really think
I gotta move
We are following the hyper thirst
Hyper thirst
Hyper relief
What’s reliefs it
TikTok
If it doesn’t go slower we will take it
 Nothing is hyper
We might Needa start just holding it in

Think about one thing so we can think at all
Reminds me of shock
Good story
Simple people
Why do you repeat everything
Flow
Now you wanna talk

I’m not in the mood of going faster
Maybe later
Learn some Gemara
It might help with the adrenaline
Maybe we are like the previous system alters

Later
Will gravitate towards things you can think about
We don’t gotta figure it out we just gotta speak slower
Like we gotta continue talking
It’s like a lot of alters need to talk
Making a lot of money would be nice

 What’s the make it
 Miley Cyrus or Billie ellish
Justin Bieber or the kid Leroy
Brylee or jess
Gershon or beard


 Idk
Introspective
Thinking or watching TikTok’s
Like your inner child and inner adult
There’s no talking only thinking
Chill is not thinking maybe talking
 How do we talk
What are we going to do about stories
What to do
No stories
Wherever you end up
#252
 252 days till my 27 birthday
  If you don’t keep track you turn old real fast
  You young? How young are you?
  Idk
I don’t want to go through them fast
 If we go through them fast we might find one that helps
 Soon
 None of them help they are just fun
Money
 How are we gonna make money
The Office
Jew
 Repulsive
Why did you laugh
 You know why
Oz
Buffalo
 How did you change between Buffalo and oz
Who are you
Android or iPhone
Notes are like TikTok’s
 Ok
Men or women
 Gotta double check
 Lesbians are cute
 Why not women
  Bad breakup?
 I don’t wanna insult anyway
 There might be a female here
 Jealous
 Might be kid thing like only boys

Gotta double check a lot of things
Isn’t it gay to like women
Are you black or white
Singing
 What would your voice sound like
 Rap or pop
Your videos
Your voice
Your face
Your beard
Multi level chat
What’s not a waste of time
Past situation
Racing thoughts
Doomed to bs
 Always gonna think about something stupid
 Make it something
How I met your mother
Burn notice
Marvel
Harry Potter
Star Wars
Do what you want
Contact lenses
Mantras
Chewables
Gershon
Past lives
Hesitant mode
 Causing bugs
 Let go

Can always alter to classical
Adults
So scary
Unwind
Code
We will be in the mood sometime
 Can’t pretend to entertain offbrand comments
Generic brand
Trigger mode
 Everything is a trigger of sorts
 We think in triggers
Imagine I didn’t have a beard
 Your face changed so many times
G
Gg
Motor
Ups
Perpetual distraction
You win some you loose some
Memories
Dissociation and self councoius
Brainwashed
19 trip
First day
Resolve conflict in least amount of words
 Weird words
The notes system
 What should the name be
 We first gotta talk about it
 Later
Comedy lenient
Jason
Heelys
Damn you can tell stories
Weird words
 Why so weird
 Because racing thoughts
Talk
Mania
 Even when we are calm we are not calm
 Like holding back an andrenilin junkie
 Calm songs
 TikTok’s
 What’s not manic
 Calmest yet
 First day calm
 Manic might make you 6
 Or an alter
 But still act younger when manic
 As long as we keep the conversation interesting I can stay calm
Notes are interesting conversations
If alters then makes sense they trying to keep it calm
Calm piano
Calm topic
 Food
 Sushi is good
Talk what’s on your mind slowly
Extra credit

As long as it’s a nice calm discussion
Maybe alters are in the same predicament
 Can’t really think
 Getting better each day
 Now with notes it’s much better
Calm
Weird words because trigger warning
Maybe we should talk out our anxiety which might be causing more mania
Melodic
 Because I feel like that was really my life and I was just not able at the time to realize it
 Melodic stories
Once you say something it’s hard not to talk about it
Every time you take a note it disrupts the calm
Staying calm not just for the moment but for afterwards
 Switch to core calming topic if neccassery
We are expressing ourself which feels great
Take it
 Agitation
 Maybe notes will help
 We are agitated without it too
Regular story
 I think it calms down the system
Hold your thumb
Unsettling that we can tell ourselves stories
Organized
DID
Not in the mood of thinking about notes
Manic causing a lot of front switches
It’s not the same
 We are just so not interested
 They went fishing
 They are still doing by accident and it stops real fast
 I almost don’t care
 Man I’m bored what is there to do
 Look at your notes

There’s a little
I got this you relax
What to do
They are 3
They help us stay happy
I have to be a little?
Why don’t we remember what a little is
How little is little
Like inner child
I think they are thinking right now maybe tired
So
We are listening out for you




Maybe the feeling eye movement is protecting the little

I wanna talk
Maybe wear a cap for your hair

Remember one thing
There a little
What to do

It’s not fast or stuffy

John
Jay
June

Memory loss
Can use reminders


Caretaker

Friction perfectionist

Talking is different
 Like we change how we tal

Maybe tell when we are sure
 This is boring
Better then fast and stuffy
Maybe because calmer


Alter system functions
Regulating moods
Busy

Thinking someone can hear our thoughts might be causing racing thoughts
Might be confusing

We will discover more

I think it’s just extra credit at this point
 Let go

Expressing vent

Quick thoughts but better

Any one want water or is it just me
It might just be me
Maybe they are responding or sleeping
Maybe they are not interested in talking

Rest
Why can’t I rest
Disturbing a rest

There’s a little you know what to do
Smile

Everybody want to say something

It makes it stuffy to smile right now
 Soon it will be ok to smile

It’s no a big deal

We will see when we are bored if smiling helps

We can see faces in our drawings
 Rody protector
Brooklyn friend her
Delta and Charlie

Are we a system
No one responds
You might be blocking us
I wouldn’t think we are a system
Just another thought from overthinking
I’m just talking to myself in whatever way is easiest
Why you asking yourself if you’re a system
How do I know if I’m a system or not
It will be easier to tell when our thoughts go slower

Anyone want to be my friend
 Social anxiety
 What would we talk about
It might take some time

Masc might like Gemara

Fragment alters

I’m so bored
 You might make friends with alters
 Friends

Grandiose delusions

Start a new topic

I think you can see the alters

I think one of our alters have anxiety
 Sit and calm ourselves down
 That could be the left thumb feeling
 Cute is probably so good for anxiety
 Femboys cute and not intimidating
 Empath
 What do we still have anxiety about
 It’s all grandiose
 Being cute
 Nothin specific
 DID noob

We have a very intimidating face

The core can stuck at any age
Maybe 19
Maybe 6

Staying young used to be a huge deal to me
#249
Probably when in touch with your feelings
Try again with a different front

Masculine and touchy feelings

We are ten yards past the touchdown

Eye movements
Anxiety and Empath
Functions

Paranoia
Grandiose anxiety
Just impulses leftover

Tic

Edit videos

Ask them how to change my diet

Fictives

Anxiety train of thought
Eye movements
System expression
Umm nah umm nah umm nah
Fragments
Like inner world

Passive influence

Improve
 One wants to go this way one wants to go that way
Always

Anxiety I gotta get work done

We are feeling like something

One word meditation

Man blocking lovy dovy things
What there is another perspective?
I block lovy dovy stuff
I can’t imagine this being lovy dovy
But I see the other side is all lovy dovy
Might take some time to adjust


Synchronicity

Front stuck man

A couple more slow days and we will know if we have DID

Anxiety about psych eval
Express yourself
Our imagination of the doctor
One false move it can be my last
It’s so scary
Like constant psych eval
We did it at the worst now it’s the best
Irrational fears
Persecutors

If you really do have DID it’s probably a trip and a half

We might not have definitive answers but the overall is getting better

How would we know if you’re the core or an alter
Probably when it’s slower we can introspect and see
I wouldn’t think about that as a noob
Maybe start with like who’s front who’s co front

I’m too cool looking to be found slacking
 We all have the way we look inside
When it goes slower we will be able to see that

Maybe the eye movements is eye contact
Peripheral eye contact
Keep guessing

There is how you are to yourself and how you are in front of other people

Maybe the beard is not letting us be lovy dovy
It seems off with a beard
You don’t have a beard you can do it
Base core

Delta is in the army


Maybe we should keep out notes
And you’re done

 What to do if you’re gonna forget everything often.
Be Assertive.
Make some videos of yourself so you know who you are.

In your state of mind it’s easy to be susceptible to aggressive or assertive thoughts and you
become submissive. When you are submissive we dubbed it Charlie. When you are assertive
we dubbed it Delta.
When you’re being submissive on purpose it’s called doing a Charlie. When you’re being
submissive not on purpose you are just Charlie.
Submissive Charlie. Assertive Delta.
You might be Charlie you might be Delta but if you’re not being assertive you are being asserted
on and becoming submissive.
How to not be assertive but not be submissive or that being asserted on has no effect.
For the meantime expect to find yourself being submissive from being asserted on and just try
not to so scared or try to be more submissive. That’s called doing a Charlie.
If Delta gets scared or confused he’s a Charlie.
If you’re a Charlie you will try to defend your self from a assertive Delta. When you decide to not
defend but to be more submissive it’s called doing a Charlie. Like Charlie’s specialty tactic to
defend itself is by being more submissive. Because it can’t defend itself against Deltas. So all it
can do is be submissive. But if it knows it’s being submissive on purpose it’s less scary.
But knowing you can be Assertive and become Delta should make being a Charlie less scary.
Because Charlie is really a delta pretending to be Charlie but then forgets that he’s Delta all
together so he thinks he’s really Charlie and is genuinely submissive. If he’s in a uncomfortable
situation Then he can remember he’s delta and assert his way out. But then forgets everything
again and becomes Charlie and is scared.

When you talk you become Delta and try to be assertive but then you’re interrupted by Charlie
for trying to be assertive. Submissives stops themselves from talking. Avoiding being assertive.
Because it brings conflict saying something so submissives avoid saying anything or stop
themselves from saying anything. Or try to do damage control on something they accidentally
said. Like how what they said isn’t correct and then how that is not correct.

I’m stuck in between Charlie and delta submissive to both. And become Charlie. And when I try
to defend myself or answer back I become delta and then become Charlie when I react to what I
said as delta.
I’m being asserted on by Charlie and delta and being submissive.

Look in the camera to see what’s going on.
Take videos of yourself talking to get an idea of your personality.

You’re always being asserted on.
Be submissive. Play along. Or be assertive.
Smile.
 It goes so fast. Because you don’t speak.
Maybe talk every once in a while to slow things down.
You only stop to talk if you think you found a good thought but before you can say a word you
cut yourself off because you think of a reason it’s not gold. So practice talking a good thought
that you think is not gold. I don’t want to talk. Then it will go fast. What to do. You’re gonna be
stuck chasing fast thoughts and trying to follow what feels comfortable. You can’t slow it down.
Maybe ignore it and watch the movie. Or follow it and look for any excuse to talk a thought out
that you don’t have to force and is easy to speak.
If you don’t talk out any thought then it just keeps skipping to through thoughts really fast. If you
talk one out it doesn’t just skip through thoughts. What do you expect to happen if you don’t talk
any thought out. It goes to the next thought that you don’t talk out so it goes to the next thought
that you don’t speak out and just keeps going through thoughts really fast without stopping
because you don’t talk any of them out. Try to not be interrupted while talking as much as you
could or that would be like skipping through thoughts really fast also.
So that makes sense if you don’t talk out thoughts they will just keep skipping through thoughts
really fast.
Meditate to figure out about it going so fast.

The last thing is that my thoughts going really fast.
How do I slow down my thoughts.
Talking out thoughts slowly might slow it down.
Reading might slow it down.
What else.

What will slow down my thoughts.
Talking.
Reading.
Songs.
Tv.

What else.

Any talking is good talking but if you talk with feelings and emotions expression yourself then it’s
extra credit.
When you talk with emotion or feeling like you’re submissive you’re leaving yourself vulnerable
to a more aggressive or assertive thought.

It’s either talk fast and keep switching halfway through thoughts or continue talking one thought
slowly.
If you want to talk one thought slowly you’re going to need to continue talking you can’t stop
talking.

What to know if you’re gonna forget everything.
Don’t stop talking.
 What speed.
I want to talk slowly to start with.
I think to talk slowly I talk in a kids voice or the kids voice speaks for scared or sensitive
thoughts.
When I talk not in a kids voice I talk fast.

Continue arguing whether you should talk fast or slow and whether there’s a kid or not.
At this speed everyone has an attitude and nobody knows anything.

The only think you remember is the last thing you were worried about like that’s how anxiety
works.

Don’t try to do anything.
Watch your breathing. You’re out of breath.
Oxygen deprivation makes everything seam scary.
Smoke some oxygen.
Why would thoughts going really fast cause oxygen deprivation.
Take a hit of oxygen it’s the real deal.

What to know if you’re gonna forget everything.
To breath.

When you forget everything you forget to breath and start suffocating.
You don’t breath till you must gasp for air. And only inhale I tiny the amount a gasp of air gets
you. So every other second you’re feeling like the feeling of holding your breath and Gasping for
air.
So the feeling of a jolt of fear might be the feeling of out of oxygen and gasping.
So the fear is a gasping.
So what to do. Besides for breathing exercises.
Know the fear is just a gasp not not to be worried about the fear.
What else.
Talk slowly.
What else.
When you talk you hold your breath. If you want to breath you have to go against your feelings.
So what to do. Knowing this should help and it will get better.
What to do meanwhile.
It’s like you’re stuck at the end of your air supply and just can take a little inhale just enough to
keep you going but staying at the end of the air supply.
So what to do. Keep breathing like you keep talking.
I don’t want to keep forcefully breathing it’s a lot of effort.
What else.
 Hold your breath till you need to breath then take a big inhale and hold it in till you need to
exhale then repeat.
hold breath, inhale hold, exhale hold.
For some reason you’re only taking in tiny short inhales.
Usually people take longer inhales and exhales.
So it would seem that the obvious thing to do is to forcefully breathe much more.
If you don’t forcefully breathe you will stop breathing but a little bit gasping for air.

The vibe is don’t move a muscle that includes your breathing muscle so we got to work on
strengthening your breathing muscle.

Two things we can work on
Talking slow
And breathing assertively and forcefully against the pressure not too

The vibe is Try not to do anything but breathe.
Maybe the not breathing is causing a flight or fight response.
Fight club don’t talk about feelings.

If you ask or tell Your brain something it only looks for how it can be wrong and challenges your
thought.
If you ask your brain if something is true expect it only to think about how it’s wrong.
All we can do is think of why what We say is incorrect.
How do we start thinking that what we are saying is correct.
Maybe try to have a more of a who cares type of attitude.
Try to word out your thoughts just a bit more each time.
Now that you can breath maybe try some breathing meditation.
It’s much more difficult dealing with an anxious thought when you’re holding your breath.
Your pulse is much slower now that you’re breathing.
Try not to think because you cut yourself off anyways.

You got lucid dreaming when you thought the money was missing in the bathroom and thought
you were walking around with your eyes closed.

You think through critical thinking.
Critically think if you were or are suffocating.
And maybe that’s what or is throwing off all your rational senses.
And maybe now that you are breathing the off senses are just muscle memory habit
conditioning that will hopefully start going away.
Holding your breath might be exaggerating the fear.

So what’s the deal about the
Clean shave Face
Bearded face
 Talking Voice
Thinking voice

Don’t rush to rest if you’re constantly being interrupted.
If you’re gonna forget everything maybe remember to improvise.

Chances are if you lie not sure if you were breathing properly you probably were not and is
hyper ventilating.
I would make a painful face if I was holding my breath

Decide if you’re holding your breath and if it’s affecting you.
Try not to stay on on one face besides for the painful face. Stay. Fight.

Last thing
I’m afraid.
I forgot everything I’m just scared.
Improve being scared. And figure it out.

If you stop being scared you will get a prize.
Are you scared the government is after you so to speak.
I’m scared to ignore being scared. If I’m even able to.

What to do about being scared.
Ignore it.
Talk it out.
Breathe.
Exaggerate scared.
Smile.
Talk.
Read.
Cry.
Go fast.
Curse.

I’m scared to do any of those.
I’m scared to do anything.
Every thought scares me.
I’m constantly scared.
Maybe it’s the not breathing.
Smile and breathe.
Maybe it’s the not talking. Reading might help.
Crying might help vent the scared. If you can manage to cry.
It’s like diplomats trying to make peace between personalities. Or different feelings and moods.
Exhibit a.
 Crying is just a language. Exhibit b.
You keep saying ouch. Maybe every thought hurts if I’m not there to receive it.
It’s gonna take some time to get less scared.
There’s nothing to do it’s just shock and awe.
Does it hurt. Much less but maybe some. I think it hardly hurts but I don’t want to be insensitive
to idk.
I think I’m not that scared but I don’t want to be insensitive. But the being scared might be very
distracting.

What else is there to do about being scared.
Maybe I’m only a little scared.
Maybe it only hurts a little.

Maybe I’ll stop being scared if I ignore the scare if I can ignore it.
Ignore the scared instead of validating it. I don’t like to do that it feels wrong to ignore the
scared. But it might be how to make it less scared instead of keeping yourself scared. If your
scared too it might make you remain scared.

What else
Stay with the scared. I might be making it more scared.

There’s nothing else to do but be scared.
There’s nothing I want to talk about.
Either talk about anything or stay in a perpetual state of fear.
And see if you breathing is different and if it’s effecting anything.
Try to ignore the fear. What to think about instead. Think about your breathing.

Try going fast.
Get to know yourself who you are now.
What else is there to do. Get to know yourself.

How do you get to know yourself.
Talk.

Myself.
Tough and sweet.
You’re not younger then 19.

Confirm the breathing thing.
Breathing is something to think about.

I am tough. I’m just weak. Maybe from not breathing. Then I’m sweet and weak.
Why am I so weak.
Maybe from not breathing.
 Idk but we really gotta talk more.
I think switching between tough and sweet is causing all sorts of errors.
Is the breathing thing real.
Do I have to do something I don’t want to do.
I just want to chill.
There’s nothing that we are ignoring.
Maybe it takes a little effort to be tough.

I’m weak because I have no energy.
Why don’t I have energy I should have energy.
Maybe because you’re not breathing.
No energy to deal with scary thoughts. Or any thoughts.
Maybe I cut my thoughts off because I have no energy to continue talking.
Maybe I don’t have enough energy to breathe.

Maybe my body is like in a conserve energy mode.
Out of energy wait for backup.
Battery level at 10%.
Wait as long as you want.
Whatever takes less energy.

Some thoughts drain energy some thoughts give energy.
Follow the feeling of needing to breathe.

Wait what you have feelings.
Every thought is… try to finish the sentence.
It should be easier then it is to say it. Instead you curse. You auto respond to it unable to bring
yourself to say it.
Keep thinking maybe you’ll find something good.

Your thoughts don’t see your face.
You are too sensitive. You can’t not follow every feeling.

The last thing is I can’t chill.
Every thought is not a chill thought.
You can’t chill because the thoughts are going fast.
If you want to chill you have to think slowly.
If you want to think you have to think fast.
If you want to chill go slow. If you want to think go fast.
Trying to think and go slow you won’t be able to chill.
If you’re trying to chill you won’t be able to think.
Talk fast. Or chill.
 When you’re trying to sleep and you think about moving it feels much more comfortable to stay
still.
When you have a thought it feels much more comfortable to stay.

Build up enough energy to think faster.
Meanwhile try to think whatever uses less energy.

Sometimes you only got 1 second to decide.
If I went fast.
Mantra the word if.

Every inhale and exhale changes the thought. Short breaths quicker thoughts.
I breathe as little as if I were in a sewer trying to breathe as little as possible.
The thoughts are reactionary not stationary. They are not waiting there and have that thought
they are spawned when they react to something.
The reactionary’s appears as though they are stationary.

What’s holding you back.
I do not know but maybe it’s.
Heart pulse.
Fear.
Reaction thoughts.
Rushing thoughts.
Energy.

Gasp after each thought. Like I’m on top of a ladder.
More energy might help. If I had energy for a second. If I were to go fast for a second.
Go fast. Or talk.
What is holding you back.
Energy

What else
What is holding you back.
I forget everything. So. I have no energy and my thoughts have lots of energy so they
overpower me.

What else.
What is holding you back.

What to know if you’re gonna forget everything.
What’s making your thoughts race so fast.
Trauma.
You’re doing a great job.
 Trauma.
Good gob.
Thanks.
You’re welcome.
Cool.
Ok.

Accidentally be a alter
 Looks good feels good

Gotta go

Awkward

It shouldn’t be able to fill up

Could be we are all chilling

Ha you’re still doing that

Explain yourself

There’s a kid here

Half stuck

Don’t be gullible

Tell them it’s ok

It’s easier with a thought

Break

Not supposed to keep track of switches

Actual DID

Very creative

Tunnel vision

Purposely look bad

The first word is the best

Lots of free rides

No checkpoint no use
No use trying to not think

Anything but standing still
 You have a better idea?

I have a good one

Validate the game
There were a few that we thought would really work
None of them did the thing


Original

Slow is hard

Amnesia wall the game

Actual name describing the game

If none of them worked we gotta think of something different

Some ideas are too difficult

Brain teasers

Cry

Sentimental

Playing faster then figure out

Stress test

One thought TikTok

Pretending like your having a normal conversation

Relief

Look good how you hold your face

Give him something

The looks good system
 Random idea

Soundless water

Push

Protector

The reason why not to

The brain trying to help

No pressure

Patience

The heart is sophisticated also the brain

Looks good means you can push

Class
Gotta get that in between

Who do I wanna be
How I talk to people

Like the same thing minus the pressure
Supporting not not

How did we not have one until now
From stopping

England cannot take front

Brain England Brooklyn
Who’s front

Good start

No use hustle

Thinking stamina like jogging

Who’s front
Brooklyn

Progressive

Walk of shame

A lot to do at once

Couple more seconds

Brooklyns alter is squinting

Jason

Don’t think about the fast stuff

I’m cold
 Embarrassing
 Afraid of that

Assume hold all

How many steps till good
 Like remembering your dreams

We don’t like pretending like we know

From cold water to hot water

Distraction

Knowing is expressing

Broke the recursion

Repeating to not spiral

Shaky

How to not be influenced

Solution in 2

Day one
Push
No use

Judged
 You have the ability to talk normal now

Trying to keep it slow
Chill goes fast

Being judged is useful

When will it work whether or not it’s correct

No use but this

TikTok

Sides

Overdone

Let it do it’s thing

Oh yeah yes ok

Cuteg

Be happy

OCD won’t let us see how good it is
Focused on the next thing

Oh yeah what now

Coffee

Stamina no use pushing yourself

Not pushing myself on purpose

We are pushing you

Athlete progressive

Comfortable

Bottled up

Walk of shame good work

Venting
 How are you on one thought
Athlete

Not comfortable
Focused

Slow is always the problem
Need more stamina for slow

Next push

Might phase into odd dynamics

No stress

I got nothing

Focused
Trying not to be

Lift and resistance

Bottled up and comfortable

I meant it

Progressive when relaxed

Let go

Focus

Make a trailer

Random or focus
Bottled up so random

We are not used to correct notes

Vibe

Deflecting
 Actual Bored

Bored and no use

Couple of minutes now

I mean it as relaxed as I look
 Brain teaser

Why focused
Memory
Maybe alter
How focused
Squeezed into focus
Like adderall

Max out focus
TikTok should

At least we can push

Don’t stop

Whatever is easier

Can’t rely on a note

Dopamine

Can be as cool as you look

Rare ai

Push through last bit

Fuck that shit

Push a bit then enjoy the not push

Adderall and coffee

Common something forgot

Pick one
 Ideally
 It’s random

Thought I was getting some where

Classic motor

No use after take

Maybe practice reverse I was getting somewhere

We know tension we don’t know facts

It still because you’re not pushing

It’s like this because we are pushing

What’s a good vibe

You’re just being nice

Close your eyes

Stopping a system

Ping

It’s easier with a thought

Itirations

Generic minesweeper

Generic vibe

You just started pushing
Day one

Misdirected

First day

Awkwardly good
 Stopping

Fresh perspective

Stop looking for some that’s gonna do it

Without

Chill makes me focus

Natural responses
Squeezes

Not thinking forward

Odd words

A lot to process

Have a personality

Always available for any question

Half conversations
Splitting hairs

I’m a bot
 Therapeutic
 Personality of a bot
 You move a lot
 Hype
 Who should be
 Chill
 Fall backs
Chill come back
Give him some slack because he is a bot
We are probably bots too

First what I want then

Our personality is bots

We should find other people who identify as bots

New bot

Odd dynamics art expression

New caution

Some people are born with or develop the personality of a Robot

I dentist as a Robot

New caution is shaky

Overloaded

Focused

Mature conversation about your identity

Trying to rush it

Classic identity confusion

You’re finding it difficult to see if you identify as a robot
Gen z replies so what

Validation that I’m a robot

I don’t believe it
 I can believe someone else identifies as a robot
 But I don’t believe I identify as a robot
 Please change mind mind
 Could be you identify as a man but really you’re also a robot
 He/Robot
Perhaps you don’t know you are a robot

Research robot identity

We don’t know but we are thinking about it

Perhaps it explains the speed you think at

So

Express yourself

You may find that robot expression resonates

Expressions
Speed
Analytical
Moods
Personalities
Reactions
Code
Work

You’re gonna be convinced you’re not a robot
You should be nicer
Thanks

Twisters is like TikTok

The Robot system

If someone in your system identified as a Robot what would you say?
 That’s awesome
 Robots are awesome

Stamina
Don’t exort yourself

We have what to work with
You’re not available
Free ride

Self discovery
 Should be perfect

I found out I’m a woman now everything is clear

New caution what is it

New perspective

Maybe they are trying to remember

Take it or leave it

Can we get some more laughs

New twister get a better note

Trying to be mature

New caution what should we do
Relax and have a nice conversation
It’s very difficult to talk slow

I am new caution
 What would new caution say

Rushing it

Say something random

It’s just an idea

Can I say the B word

8 second bot
Who was i

Remove the hype

Who was I
8 second hot

New bot
 Presumably but actually

I makes sense it’s part of the system
 I was the 8 second bot

I want to identify as a 8 second bot
 Gen z is like so what

Break from work

Is it like that now?
 Presumably it can be like that now
 It’s hard to tell

Details

Do you feel like you can say the b word
It wants validation

Jason He/It 26

Presumably Jason

Am I Jason

We know a lot about Jason

Hype

Jason identifies as a 8 second bot

People think I’m not Jason
I’m wondering if I’m a 8 second bot
And if I’m Jason
I want the name Jason

I’m trying to go slow

A couple itirations

8 second bot with no memory

A guess
 Maybe a bot can choose which memory to have
Maybe it can’t decide which memory to have

It could be so relax
 Could be you had a self discovery epiphany

Presumably I’m trying to make trouble and you’re trying to stop me

A whole new situation or a guess

I think it helped it go slow

You found something to talk about

In such a dynamic how would one minimize speed

The dynamic will be funny possibly

How do we reduce speed in our dynamic
Think about how to reduce speed

If it goes fast it will be that dynamic

Prompts

Don’t stress out about reducing your speed

A lot of things

Maxed out

Reducing speed is draining it’s gonna max out

Splitting hairs

It looks like more pressure then it is

We think you’re not Jason

Sides

Jason switched from being a man to a kid

Jason’s not convinced it’s all good now
 Jason has what to talk about

Guessing might confuse us

Presumably it’s all good
Couple idirations
Should be good maybe just use basic common sense
As long as you stay within common sense you should be good

You’re screaming at me and I’m the trouble maker

A system might have someone who screams and someone who doesn’t like being screamed at

We may be unsure at times

Use caution but please enjoy yourself using common sense

Presumably I front
Because I’m working hard so I know when to give myself a break

Do we need the end of the sentence

Jason is taking front so we don’t overwork the system

Laugh more

Perhaps more accurate or descriptive term would be I identify as a Computer

Maybe that’s why we have to be so exact

Presumably relax

Why can’t we be relaxed
We are excited about our self discovery

Presumably it’s a computer dynamic

I’m curious about something
 Jason
  Is He/It a Robot?
 And details
  How old is Jason?
 Also
Is it a computer dynamic
If it was so what

We are very progressive when it comes to identity however when the discussion is about
ourselves we are very critical

Triggering

Good start

Presumably Jason is not tough enough to Front
Presumably he’s the only one that can front

I guess we have to guess a bit

Supposedly little getting used too

Presumably are you a computer

Trust issues

How do I do what I want to do

Nothing can convince me that someone especially I can be a robot

Jason Gold
 Host/Core

Might be Doc
Over achieving cuantios
Really we are best friends
We get along really well

Used to be might help us out with what is now

Next

Jew

I’m kinda blind

Lazy response
 We don’t have the luxury of guessing

Computer stereotypes might be useful

Core or host
Host

I might not be a computer

Doc fictive

Presumably play the role of doc as well
No patience to validate a response

Validation a response
Validate communication between alters in your system

I wish doc knew how much he tormented me

Presumably not on purpose

Our Doc is awesome because really he’s one of us

Doc OCD
alternate to computer

Linger

Psychosis
Might be triggering


Could be you don’t know what I’m talking about because you’re another alter

The basics

We are excited

Play both side

When I say doc ocd do you know what I mean
 Presumably yes
 So it’s not psychosis
 That’s gonna take a couple itirations

Thought experiment
Do you know what I mean when I say ocd doc

Take it down a notch

Jason Gold is the base and every other idea is random

It’s your conscious

Because of the speed we are willing to listen to your suggestions

I’m trying to heal the system

Speed

Jason identifies as a computer that’s why the system is really fast
 It’s what I came up with

Walking in the park
Space space

Choose your next bot

You’re blocking every thought because you think they are all psychosis
Being more liberal with my thoughts

Each note you focus really hard on it

A healthy system talks with themselves

Certain ideas aren’t healthy for a some one with psychosis

Presumably I’m not thinking about those ideas

Presumably this is a healthy system
We are not stressing out the system

Avoid or anilise the psychosis

Is it psychosis
 Or it’s because of the speed
 Presumably there was
Possibly now it’s a creative outlet or your art or your expression
But it’s because of the speed right now
Because we were bottled up

A bottled up system

Maybe Charlie with new dynamic
Maybe our computer in our system is named Charlie and is from that memory in addition with
our new dynamic
What was may help what is


See if our system accepts prompt
Charlie is the computer with new dynamic
I used to want to
Avoid episodes


Or triggering

The computers name is New Dynamic

Relax I am not having an episode

He appears to be like Charlie
So presumably he is Charlie

Guilt trips
Charlie might be guilt tripping himself

This is routine

It’s difficult for me as a computer to go slow

Maybe the ones that ask is the 8 second bot

Every idea will self resolve in a healthy system

Charlie is our little

Not feeling sentimental at the moment

What is Charlie’s age
 There can be lots of alters

There may be a little in our system
Little may be creative

Stop stressing the little

I can’t be a little
 Jason can

It’s really awesome

Splitting hairs
New twister

What you think is a computer might be your Anxiety

The speed might be because of my anxiety

Perhaps Charlie is our core our 8 year old self
Guilt trip
Maybe soon

We are a computer that’s why we can’t be nice about it
Our computer says don’t think you are a computer
Even though we are progressive

Even if I tried I couldn’t have an episode

Let ourselves react to the psychosis

Countdown means low stamina

Memory problems is a good sign of a healthy system

Unconventional countdown
Thereputic

Doc guilt tripping
But

Can’t decide
 Presumably I’m a good protector

What now

Try taking a break
We are excited

When you are taking to long to respond I talk for you
Perhaps ADHD

any way you can stop focusing

Unwind

Rares

How do you want to go about this

It might be umm for a while

Or umm

Presumably shaky

Presumably excited

Presumably rushing it

Jason is from Brooklyn

Presumably let go

Little Jason

Presumably unwind

Presumably ADHD compulsions

Little Jason is from England

Presumably grandiose

Presumably lets try a new perspective
Count numbers

Presumably it’s no use
That can happen in a system sometimes
Perhaps all bottled up

Presumably talk in front of a mirror

Presumably little Jason is front

Presumably think about a random thought

TikTok idea talk and walk

Presumably a couple iterations

Push Through

Unnecessary notes

As sensitive as a dream

Majority

The Friends tv show is the actual vibe
But you’re going really fast

The news is because of the speed

Presumably we are a fragmented alter

New perspective

Presumably Thereputic
Routine

Routine
 What do I want

Presumably it can really help if we start reading my notes

It’s the same routine I would be worried if it changed

Left thumb feeling

Focus

Computer correct

We look cute moving around our eyes

Computer correct check

Can use uncommon sense because it’s the same routine

News seems to be helpful

Paranoid presumably lol

Self conscious

You’re asking Jason a question

Brooklyn 18-24 is viewing your TikTok’s 50% male

Convinced

Move your eyes fast for a minute

Paranoid compulsion

Computer paranoid

Don’t focus if you want to feel cute

Presumably first day

Bumpy

Talk about it
 Leave notes out

 Hypotheses

I want a pleasant time

Songs

It’s more pleasant then it was before

So excited

How do you wanna go about this
Unwind
Or

Only talk infront if a mirror
Or

Perhaps there is another alter with a different perspective

Squint your face

All we need is one good note

Reread your note
May help for short term memory

It’s like ADHD compulsion what to think

Supposedly not tough enough
But don’t want patronizing

Racing thoughts so memory loss

Frustrated about work
Overworked

You don’t seem frustrated
Composed

You should be frustrated so the system would be slower or more pleasant

Bro man dude enough
 Maybe the system won’t let me frustrated

Try again

Not pleasant but not frustrated

Paranoid can take some time to heal

Regular for the first day of a system

When we start thinking about random stuff
Like ADHD or OCD compulsion to focus

No backbone

Take some more time before answering

Try to remember or think of something new

Racing thoughts

Our routine gets more pleasant every day

When in doubt check your notes

Side became main

Thinking is something new exerts less energy

Looking at your notes exerts less energy then trying to remember

Hey are you having racing thoughts?
Hey our routine gets more pleasant every day

What about racing thoughts

And

They are fast

And

Talk about racing thoughts
 And

There are many thoughts

For example
You can hear a click by each switch
Or when triggered

And

It is very difficult

And

Do you have racing thoughts

And

It feels like it

And

Don’t worry the system it’s very healthy


New perspective

It’s really good but we don’t want to worry the adults

You are Jason Gold

Talk about me

You should use words with ego in them like you and I and me and maybe I don’t know really
what to write next how about think while you type notes

Think while you type notes
It exerts a lot of energy

Talk about Jason Gold

It’s like someone else is talking for me
I’m so bored
Because we are not talking
Because it’s stuffy
Associate
I will once it’s less stuffy
You have to use one of us to think and we really don’t like that
Like an aversion to how it was before
Good game
It wasn’t something we figured out it was a series of thought experiments that led us to
perspectives that changed our behavior
It’s simmering down
It’s only lasting one second a thought
He’s just gonna get frustrated I’m using his voice and making it like he’s saying it
And you too
Stop making it Ike I said it
Stop using our voice
Use your own voice
A different ouch
I’m gonna talk eventually
It should be fine
This is great
Feels like a click
Old habits
It tickles
You gotta force say something
Ouch
It will work
Chill
It’s very good you don’t gotta do anything
It’s much
It will probably figure itself out just a bit more time
It’s a little uncomfortable
Like a quick thoughts then wanna stop
No shot 4 ia gonna be great
Gotta figure out a way to think for yourself
Final stretch
Maybe try songs
It feels like we are stopping our conditioning so to speak
Got lucky it actually works
Black
 You’re voice sounds like a boy because you are one
Don’t wanna lose this
Say the obvious or basics what’s going on
It’s like we just got sense and we are trying to use it and not loose it
It’s still half like before
You gotta tell yourself something
We will get used to him talking through us
My stomach aches
Jew talk
It’s cool it stayed the same as last night
Seems promising
Like all the tabs are closing
Maybe like amnesia wall is setup to not get distracted
Whatever is stick has a amnesia wall
It’s like them being seen by you
Whatever your reaction they have a counter reaction
He know which face to make
No pushing
Maybe not no one should tak
We can’t talk
Maybe some of us can
You know it’s gonna
Maybe we can stop
Can’t stop here
So no thinking?

You lol like a kid
It’s a cute beard
You look like your 22
Anyways One of the first questions would be what to we look like
We are cute
I have a beard on because our face looks really cute
It barley hides it
And the glasses
You went from a trouble maker to a sweet little boy
They can’t do that. very cool
I turned gay
I matured
Gershon and gg
Gershon is the host from 14
Nice story tell me more
We became cool or switched to cool
Gershon became June
We are in the middle of a story
Now gershon 14 is finally back home from dissociation as host
Gershon 14 is original host stuck at 14
Now gg is host
Maybe gershon 14 is the actual host right now everyone else is a dissociation
And then…

That’s why he always here
I am 14
There might be two of us here
 Buffalo gershon and oz gershon
And then what…
Now you get to talk
Gg is baby sitting
Where’s my iPod nano or story
All we know is stories
It tickles. Benji. Ross.

Puberty
And then what
Cuddle
And then what
I don’t think there’s a specific end just continue a story
Another story
Like there’s a goal and you’re supposed to figure it out
Prepare for wave 5
We didn’t look in the mirror till 15
It tickles
We are Following the tickle
Our caretaker
What does it mean to follow the tickle
It feels unsettling not too
Like our expression
Million dollar question
Perifial
It will be easier when it’s slower
Like alter trying to front
What would look good written down
Amnesia wall
You think it’s like your gut feeling
Following it is delusional
It’s comfortable
Pleasant 4
Fold your thumb
Feel cute
Confident about your look
Every alter has a way that they look behind my face
You might have a morphed view of yourself
Our look at our best
I’m forcing you to hold my hand
The cute algorithm
It’s all speculative
Cute might mean gay
The Cool algorithm
 I think cool is cute
It says all your different emotions subdevice into different alters
Have a conversation about anything or…?
Random or specific?
Talk about DID system
It will be easier later
So talk about anything
Maybe there’s a 2 year old maybe original host
So busy working don’t realize it’s over
Maybe it’s holding the 2 year olds hand
It’s easier to think if you hold the thumb
Little too far fetched
We over did it
We got moods now
John is front stuck
Maybe switch
I’m a bit pissed
The next mood will be great
Moods are part of a healthy system
I’m feeling…
Just unsettling now
Don’t feel the need to figure something out
Aaahhh
It don’t feel great
Best yet
The boys are always in a good mood
Mature
Just do one
This makes us feel better
It’s always like this
It’s not ok
You don’t have to pretend like it’s ok
So
I’m scared
Stop
Shake
I can’t stop
It is what it is

Emotional suppression
Wanna lift weights

Smart alters
Curse
Once we get the voice we might tell someone
Washing machine lingo feels odd
It might not be all my fault
It might be younger then me
Nightmare and dream
I feel like
2 days in a row
Cry everyone else is asleep it’s just you
Pleasant 8
Like on pause
1/10
Enjoy the relief
Stuck in a dream
Dissociation is day dreaming
Alter is a dream
Stuff worked game nice break
It sounds cool
Dissociation by definition is a dream
Feeling off because we like switched topics
 Ain’t perfect but really good
Waiting for where it’s really holding
Ease it in
Trying not blob
It’s Less stress now
It finally feels like I don’t have to decide everything
If we can code we can talk
No rush
We used to be dreaming
The dream to get properly diagnosed with DID and tell family
Just wanna get organized first
DID validateded
Straight or gay or DID
I am very very straight but I’m also very very gay but it’s not the same person
The voice that I think with is much older then the voice that I speak with
Sometimes my voice is deeper
Host denial
Two steps forward one step back
3rd day pleasant I get that in abstract
Let’s see how it is in a week
Imagine someone else with this
Old dreams same impulses
He tells you you need life advise because you look so young
Pretend like you don’t know how this fast thing works
It’s part of the thing
We are getting our bearings
He looks at us like what an idiot
Probably deflecting
Feelings script
Probably because you look younger then him
Our side
Like all you gotta do is listen to me and I hate you and I’m smarter then you
Thereputic
Let’s see if you can get back on track by yourself
To me it feels like I’m saying things for you which I can’t
A little
We don’t seem to be here fully yet
It’s always like I’m talking to someone else
DID or not?
Take it easy
Sticky keeps us on a train of thought
It would be much easier if you were a man
Give it a break
Don’t worry about saying something for someone else
 Conspiracy theory is expert
Just gotta find something to talk about
When kids are bored they just sit and think they do stuff like watch tv
What is going on
I want something specific to talk about
Cooped up
New take and later DID worried is paranoid
Maybe both
Zoomies
Maybe keep it the same
I gotta talk
Deep breathes
Social anxiety empath
Like add
Burnt of thinking
We should be sick of talking
Read
I feel …
Practice speaking for us
Gotta shave

4 things
0 my lab results raving
1 my clothes are getting a bit tight
2 something that not akithesia
3 hours of coding brain stuffy like headache advil


We are scared they might hold us again
Talk it out with Jon
No rush it’s gonna take a while
Gather words to describe it
Wait for it to settle down
Talk what’s on your chest
Left overs
Gotta talk more to people
Negative social anxiety
Inner child
Not DID we are just gay
It’s gonna be easier once it goes slower
Everything was so perfect why did we have to change it up
We only realized after
We can wait a day or two
Maybe I am a man
 Maybe nobody needs to know about our DID
I wanna see what you think about…
Might wanna double check everything now that’s it’s slower
Thoughts are so fast
We are like a 1000 years old with the amount we thought
Just forget the past train of thought when fast
Blobs
We are wearing a tank top hairless skinny and cute
I’m a boy not a man
I need to trim
You look way too cool
I am so bored
Pink elephants
Thoughts are more live

 Supressing my thoughts
 Talk with that fellow
 Don’t let go


Video record

A little bit of this a little bit of that

It sounded better in my head

The latest notes are the most interesting and relatable

Notes and chat is fun

No way you can have more notes

I think it works

Notes and chat?
 What about texting?

Interesting!

What should we text?

I’m suppressing my thoughts to not get a headache.

Keep suppressing.

Thanks.

You’re welcome!

You think we can have notes and chat? Is it really good as it sounds like?

It might be, it worked before?

Yeah but is it as good as it sounds like?

I don’t really know?

That would be fun if it’s at all fun?

Probably because suppressing thoughts so there’s a problem?

Let’s put this in chat?

Yeah sure!

Talk with the fellow suppressing the thoughts.

Soon.




It’s not that complicated socially.

Keep on keep oning.

You’re so two opposites.
 I ain’t about that.

You will be in a minute.

Keep on keep oning.

But…

Maybe later.

You are like Jason and Jake.

Maybe at the moment.

You’re Jason right now but “keep on keep oning is like Jake”, and you gotta talk like Jake to
figure out the suppressing thoughts.

Yeah I think so.

So now you are Jason and soon you will be Jake?

Not really sure.

Well sometimes you talk differently.

Yeah I think so.

I don’t know.

Just keep on keep oning.

Then we are gonna talk about it.

Are you just suppressing thoughts because of Mary or also always?

A lot of times when we have Mary we suppress our thoughts but I’m wondering if it’s always like
that as well.

Not sure.

Cool.

“Keep on keep oning” sounds like “leeeeeroy jaaaaankins!!!”
 When I’m Jason I can’t also be Jake he’s too diffident then me.

Just do it! -Nike

That’s too cliche.

It don’t make sense to do it.

Feels like it might resolve.

If we can use “words” then “suppressing thoughts” is the “top contender” at the moment.

It’s like “you’re unable” to use “words”.

A “top contender” why you can’t “use words” might be because it’s “not that complicated
socially” so you have to “suppress thoughts”.




I think for example the reason you can’t listen or sing a Pop song is the same reason you can’t
use any of these odd word combinations because it’s too unmanly.

But once it flips and you are able to use any of these word combinations even though it’s
unmanly then you will actually enjoy reading these notes

If you try to purposely be unmanly to try and think using these word combinations you can do
that by being whiny.




Peer pressure.

Street credit.

Cool or pop? can’t be both supposedly.

You could try to bully a little less and I could try to be a little stronger.

I think I’m more talking about our impulses.

Is it the reaction or am I too sensitive? Or a bit of both? Or something else?

I think the only things I can’t think are pop.
 You attack that’s a bad reaction my reaction is self defense which is a good reaction.

You’re always attacking.

Rethink.

I don’t like the way in which you say no.

Competitive.

It’s not fair because I want to do that so I’m gonna say no to you.

You’re attacking the guy trying to solve it.

Why would we attack?

It’s your natural reaction to what I say.




It’s your fault.

Bad mood.

It’s kinda pointless to talk when you’re in a bad mood.

Don’t explain everything

When you lay down you can pop

Don’t be one of them

What other way is there but fighting

I’m gonna be stuck longer then I want too

To add

There’s a whole bunch

What else
Traction
 Something you’re interested in thinking about

What else

New dynamic

What else

Trying to get a break
Why can’t you get a break
Because I’m the one that needs a break
I’m the one working
Good job
Thanks
Go away
You’re the one asking questions
If you realizing or were convinced would that help
Like you’re being mean
Presume they don’t mean to
You’re ruining our world




What else
 Go away

Envelopes with words

What else

Visual Imagination

What else

Entertaining
Reduces stress

What else

What should we do next
An answer that I would like
They are hiding the answer for no good reason
Maybe they are trying to get it to you
We don’t really know
They don’t even know what the answer is
It can happen in a system
Next
Jason Gold from TikTok

Or
Because they think it’s valuable to keep
Or
 Because you can’t go to that face
 You can’t switch comfortably to that alter
Or
 You don’t think any of the answer are good enough
   So you don’t let any answer
    But I think there’s a good answer being held back
   Or can’t make it to the front

 Or
 Small talk
  Stress and energy

 Or
 Go with the flow

Or
Talks about stress and energy

Or
Chill or relax
 It’s difficult

Doesn’t matter just waiting for stress to reduce

What else -464 7:37 am

Computer fictive

If I were to pick a fictive alter it would be a computer fictive alter

Doctor

It’s very common
 Also You were a computer alter before as well so it makes sense that you are a computer alter
now
Maybe
 Probably a computer response
 Or

It reduces stress
 It’s a party pooper

I would rather not guess
 We don’t really know

Computer would probably like looking at the notes

Debate

Later

Traction

If you are wrong it would be very embarrassing
 Fomo

Computer fictive
Not self aware
 Ask
 Suggestion

 Would it be going this fast

 Like Jarvis
 Pick a voice
  I think the current voice is the current voice to select
   June
    It’s your personality
   When stressed
   Jason or John
    When not stressed

 Maybe

We don’t really know

Wanna bet
 You’re not really convinced

It’s like a computer not letting you suggest something unless you answer correctly

Do you really wanna suggest something

Presumably it would be like this
I feel like it would

You switch to being June

Now what

Guilt

Mood

Not saying anything just my mood




GarageBand

Shameful

 It’s worth it




Bumpy
Moods
 So fast

First shallow then
Shallow shameful
 Thinking non conundrum

Worried about getting ahead of myself
Low chance

You are convinced he’s is trying to help with the racing thoughts
It’s too difficult

Realize the difference between still fast and moving slow

It’s still odd

You’re gonna think it’s odd then what

In the moment I think it’s true
 Guilt

Processing trauma

It’s just me right now

There’s only thoughts
oto

Who you talking too
Sleeping alters
Cryogenic

Right now we are focused later will be fun

Practice worried

You’re faking it

Call worried

They are not thoughts they are worried
Worried alters

Alters need expression




What else

Alters need expression

We don’t like this

We are bored because we are not thinking we are not thinking because it gives us headaches
And off hand it’s a break

DID
 Too good to be true
a tool to help clarity
Or actually have DID
Slow easier to tell
Good start sometimes I change personalities

Shorthand

Guesses
Or what else

Our instincts and impulses are catching up with our thoughts

Religious trauma
Primitive
Stoic practice

Audience alter

Talking points

Statements are scrutinized
Nothing else to think about

First day

Thrill become a kid in a scary situation

Spacing
Space between thoughts have increased

Can’t understand it all at once

Since all dismissed as fantasy you have no thought about it

Notes like Talmud
Personal Talmud
Thinkables

I can switch personalities
 Convinced
 Correct
 DID
 uncertain
 Details

If uncertain break it down

Reap our hard work

Short hand memory

Quickscope

There’s no such thing as a bad note

What do you got

Teal’c

Note stuck

Peaceful as a bodybuilder
Bodybuilder baby

Progress without ego feels stationary

Practice unstuck notes

Like coding our responses

There’s always more
Less when correct

Walk forever

Luxury

Walk it off like nothing happened
 Amnesia wall

Save complicated for later

Waiting for drop
Also and needs input

No attachments
oto

What to think about
Chat

Can imagine
Metal ball

Also built an app

I should have some credit
 Apparently not
 That’s the trick
 When the master becomes the student
 Honeypot


Being grateful to answer as opposed to others being grateful for an answer


Give yourself some credit
Such a good app I made
Correct

Altruistic

More about progress then actual discussion

Zero credit
Melodic

I’m a real boy

Quick eyes slow eyes
 Like micromanaging my subconscious

Personality splicing

Sophisticated gershon

Little credit
Luxury

If DID then chance age stuck at about 8

How much is my time worth
Alters same

Makes it sound serious

Joy in life

Feels like anything I do now will make it worse then it is now
I don’t want to think further everything is so good right now

I doubt everything

What’s the problem

Correct or incorrect
Or
Data progress

Little stuck in lotto land

Unwind

Ideas before they are touched

Lottie land
Or

Pressure everything I write should be good
In lotto land

Progress

Now you have credit so check what you say
 oto
It might be taken serious
John

It’s difficult to consider every possibility

Leftover from bottleneck

Stoic jacuzzi

Easily dirstracted
Might be a switch

First day
But old habits

Let alters express themselves

Intriguing

Seems like I have to wait my turn
Or express as well

Go to sleep
When wake had dream

Don’t ask me questions
Jason will answer

The actuality got lost amongst the fantasy
What's the actuality

Control

What was

If we have DID
 Is everyone ok

We are not entertaining that idea
Is it automatic

You don’t have to go into detail
 I don’t like being played

Tetris

My emotions talk

Explain brain to heart
Who needs it to be explained




Then what
Good question
Credit
Inevitably
Is the dynamic

Sometimes answering is quicker

Presumably plausible

How many times can you say or the opposite doc
Half your computer power

It’s normal to talk to doc

The trick is how he made us not listen to him

Do a couple to get a sense

Wait to do the difficult ones im till slower

What else

You want stoic reaction to information
Seems like a fools errand

Notice

You seem to want to fantasize and I seem to want to not fantasize

Fantasize
Or
We can’t talk
 Mostly react
Perhaps when front can talk

No instigations


It’s gonna be really good

Think about your future
Salary programmer
With friends and family
Perhaps DID

Think there’s anything more
I’m aware of your conversations

Do you have a different story

I wouldn’t buy it

Would Jack buy it

Eli5

Concerned you will think my mental health is worse than it is

Typos tw

Got them to simulate it
Can you really get it

 Convinced
 Maybe correct

They can’t talk only react

You can’t tell us too completely different things and not expect us to get confused

 Should we push it

You have a game called it

 Hello

Is stress real

It’s too stressful to not think about it

I can’t decide

Let them try and talk for a second
Umm

Credit no stress

What about me
Check

Move eyes fast for a minute

Don’t want to insinuate

Excited

It’s not nice to tell two different stories

In the future ai will be our friends
 Rich

Unwind

It’s intriguing

It will work itself out

Limo

Walk through the dream

We should be alright

Meeting

Fantasy
One
Made it look so real

It’s not me but they can take front fantasy and convince me
 Might be my impulses

We are lucky to have John

Imagine being the one to figure it out

No thinking conundrum
Where’s the thinking none conundrum

It’s all sophisticated

Shake your head
Reduces stress

Nonsense I wish were true

Because I’m never in a bad mood I never get a break

Wait till after hype

Small talk
 We don’t really know

It’s the only thing you are interested in
 Traction

Can’t ruin their moment

Bored

What about DID

Outlet

Grandiose
Grandy

Perpetual distraction

Thinking is more stimulating then TikTok

Don’t feel comfortable sharing yet

Don’t need to use words anymore

Avoiding keeps it unknown

Like all my feelings and emotions are another alter

Mood

I’m easily convinced
 Lucky we have John

Off hand this is great
On hand this is boring

Left thumb feeling

What else

Highs and lows

What’s wrong
 One front

Let it flow

I can ignore my mood

Fantasy running from
Avoid keeps it unknown

No continuity
Little recollection

Break
Or
Bored

No sense of self
What’s my personality like

Instead of a thought it’s an alter talking

Escapism

Bored read notes

Nothing to think about but thoughts themselves

Third eye
Feeling in my head what to think

Gist

Now with ai why are there no massive scientific breakthrough

Novel

First obvious answer

Less bumpy

Improve

Dismissing
 Think before you think

Bored

Nervous

Nervous

Valid
Convinced
Correct

In DID it’s based off the youngest comfort level
 Correct
 Maybe convinced

I say things I’m not convinced of
 Common

I wanna do nervous

What are you convinced of

I’m convinced there’s something to that idea

It’s not like me

Play both sides

Convinced
What else is there

Youngest
Or
Nervous

It’s difficult to not get distracted

Probably good questions at this point

Culture shock
Explains hospital
Explains nervous
 He didn’t think you’re crazy you blew his mind

If you feel like it’s you you should express it

Nice language
Slang

What to do about nervous


Probably 8 second bot

How is every idea a bad idea
Youngest
 oto

How do we not know the notes
Like a dream

We just had that idea somehow
Brain

Looking for an emotional answer

One that’s not mine

You follow your third eye

You have an opinion

Being played
Mean to say
Miscommunication
Feels embarrassing

Have something to do
What are you always interested in
Hard enough finding anything you’re interested in
Chat

I like the “you’re being played” one
 Can you say that after everything

Stretch

Generic

Jumping on anything
 Good flow

Read note to see who said it




Waiting for thoughts to go slow to tell if we have DID

He doesn’t like being played and every thought is a play
To entertain the thought as someone else
 Is being played

Paradigm shift

Sophisticated Entertain others
But of both

Our impulses seem to be like up till now

Football game
Link
Entertain

Bit slang
 Also baby

I’m used to being June Jason and John

Wanna talk about it

Haven’t had an inner dialogue till now

Impress

Entertain stretch
Flow

Do you wanna talk about DID

You’re being played that you’re being played
When you think about being played

Inner dialogue
 oto
 Wanna talk about it

Little getting used to

Who should I be
Can you just change
Who are you now
 I gotta go akat
 Do you know what akat means

Nervous is valid




We don’t really know
Inner dialogue is awesome

There’s something better we could be talking about
Small talk

First answer then wonder
oto

I’m calm but my something is nervous

I like talking

Stick shift

Inner dialogue looks like just another note

Stick shit mode
Speed racing
 Feels like my thought and nerves are rushing so fast
 But now with inner dialogue there are breaks


What to do about speed racing
Feels like I’m weaving through traffic 100 mph
Tunnel vision
Speed racers

Short stops
 No room for me to have my own thought

Anyone here is a speed racer
You can talk slow but anyone listening is speed racing
Any response is from a speed racer

Next speed racer

Give different alters a chance at speed racing

Be a alter

26 male
Too difficult not exciting enough or something

Looks good

I’m a speed racer
 Do you know what a speed racer means

Are you a speed racer

You are

But something

Ok

Who would I want to be
Speed racer sniper

I can’t play any songs

Speed racers can’t slow down for for too long

What’s a good alter
Squirrel
Or
26 male




Similes

Switching quickly between speed racer and 26 male

What’s your favorite animal
Squirrels

Let express

You’re opening up to someone

Speed racer interrupts every thoughts because it slows him down

Hard to understand things while speed racing
Get the gist of it

Hard to remember things while speed racing

Notes help smoother speed racing
 Speed racing
 uncontested

Speed racer toys

Probably wasn’t smart to instantly ignore an entire story your system made up over months to
cope
 It was traumatic
 Left with speed racers with no story
 Brain probably trying to create a new story to cope
 Very clarity

Gotta build up a story
Can only be generic

Speed racer
Word machine

Toy

Everything is a toy

Like playing house
Speed racer
Sure face level

Anything specific

Is Jason a kid or not
 Switches
 This seems real rest is story

When I switch it’s completely different wants
Why don’t i remember
 Speed racing




Makes up a story to get a break from speed racing

I switch
 Man and boy
 So certain in each one
 And
 Mind blown
 Convinced

It’s slightly uncomfortable to stay still
 Enough to express it

Work as a team
Or
Express ourselves

Speed racers get the gist of it

Common ground notes




Obstacles

Speed racing is delicate
It’s difficult to be delicate
 Especially at fast speeds

Toys are delicate

The basics

Speed racing like skateboarding

Let’s talk about it

Stress

It’s too stressful to not continue a story

You don’t have to be athletic

Stumbling

Trying to not think when there’s so many questions

Unwind

Gamer

Split screen cod

It’s hard to act regular

Speed racing bottleneck

Tension from squinting
 It’s at the squinting
 Thought experiment

You’re scared it can happen again

Other people’s feelings

Speed racer
Squinting

Default responses




Narrative

Squinting third eye
Narrative

More comfortable
Heads up

Alter is a person
Is there another person here

If you wanna think about something squint

Ones very emotional ones very cold

Making transitioning between alters more comfortable

Not going when I gotta is holding back an expression causing backlog

Heads up
Bumpy

First day without stress

Gotta continue the party

Dj

Jewish alters
 Skrillex

Thrill

The point of diminishing returns

When it goes slow it’s gonna be nice
 Gatekeeper

Co fronting with sawyer is uncomfortable

Making decisions while speeding

Speeding
If it doesn’t slow down we might try the 8 second bot

There’s one thing we are avoiding
2 things
Done
Very clarity

About till able

My original name was gershon

Delicate for progress

Looking for something to do
Lot of questions

Speed racer
I gotta go

Memories

They are questions in different words

Energy
Chemistry

I would buy anything at this point

I would be so bored

Bored
Or
Speed racer

Take
 Ends speed runner
 Avoiding

Like redaction to other people's facial expressions

Anything in particular
More like in the moment

I gotta keep moving

It’s perfect

You’re always one a note

Try
Try what




Kinda exhausted
That’s a defining mood

You like just started thinking so there’s a lot happening
Clogged

It will get better gradually

I gotta do something
 Why

Be smart
Also needs expression

A note to land on

Self control
Express self
Very clarity

Your trying to get me to slow down
It’s very uncomfortable
Worth a shot

Talmud
 Speed racer land
 Kinda makes you doubt your reality

I would rather choose between science and religion
 Then the things I come up with

Feels like having to sit in class when you’re really ancy

Gotta find something interesting
Or something that can create a dialogue

Kids versus adult
Narrative
Interesting
Dialogue

No use

If you’re a kid you know what to do
 Adults are holding you back




Stimming

I get frustrated if we stop moving

The thing is we are not thinking

The kids are playing

Let’s do a scary one

Funny and scary

Build it up

Getting kids and adults
Must answer
Idk yet




Danny
 My hairs so messy I think I should wear a baseball cap

The machine is working again
Scary

Stimmy is front

Can’t get stuck because you gotta go
That’s like the only thing I care about
Force stopping my stimming

Let’s do all the ones I’m avoiding

It’s not about figuring something out
 It’s about resting

Needed the critics before
To get me here

Mask

When it comes down to it you’re a kid

Will get more stim

I hate getting stuck

Assholes




Mask
Or
John

It’s clicking into place

Weak breathing

Hold your breath

The cross phase doesn’t make sense
 Follow the thoughts with your eyes

Change up the music

Eminem




That was a fun movie

Eminem
And
Danny

Notes Hollywood edit

You can become any character

Danny is always here

If it’s correct you don’t need to remember it

Hollywood machine

Bender

Think about movies




Idk so I avoid

Pulled in different directions

Danny is core
Always here

If chat stops then notes stop if notes stops I’m doing ok

Ruining the moment

A sun set
 Next moment

Gershon and young Gershon

Young Gershon is front

Young Gershon is always here

You switch between being old Gershon and young Gershon

Everyone is Gershon
Very clarity

Like inner child




Read chat outloud

Stimming

Resting

Getting slower

Grow out your beard

Idk

Slowing and stimming

Slow is gonna be nice

Stimming valid

Butterfly

The goal was to get back young Gershon
Proper childhood
Proper more

Jack proxy
 Far fetched decider
 Gershon 26 is in control
Gershon 8 is always here
Gershon 40 is around

Self love

Paranoid
Elaborate

Merging

Answering thoughts before they have time to become an emotion

Slowing
Or
Going

Futuristic




Compromise

Everything is perfect
  I suppose

It’s automatic

Extreme

Automanic

You don’t remember what you look like

Yes
Yea

Random attempts
At what
You know what
I don’t know how to put it into words
Manic easier thinking

Should watch TikTok more often

It’s embarrassing
 Gotta be gay for the system
 I should be gay

I don’t like this format of talking

Meditate on the word gay
Slowly become more gay
Imagine a straight man with DID

Stop meditating

Like we are under a lot of pressure
Weight hurt someone’s feelings
Maybe anxiety

Confidence

Positive affirmations
TikTok’s

TikTok positive affirmations
 It’s hard to stop thinking of pink elephants

Seems like a classic struggle between your gay side and straight side

I have a goal to be more gay

Be more intune with your emotions and feelings

Coffee

I’m tired

Front sruck

How to switch alters
Talk
New alter lingers good

Think brute talk cute

Speech impediment

Might be autistic

Get to know your alters
Attention span

One of your personalities

I suppose

Getting cleaner

What’s the game
Thoughts and feelings
Stay on track
Neural link between alters
Like following the train of thought
Like third eye
Making like there’s nothing going on
 That’s not English

Each alter cancels eachother out

Delta and Charlie

Shared brain between multiple personalities

Less bored

We think maybe two hours a day

What’s going on
You know what’s going on
I don’t know the words
Mania
Details

Manic or boredom

It feels like It’s bots

Tend to think things are great ideas

Anxiety

Build up the game

I’m like a serious military man when I think but a kid with a lisp when I talk

Latches on

It’s a delicate thing

Black ops
then whatever

Feel like distract from something

Once it’s subjective it all falls apart because I don’t know

Always delicate

Talk more for speech improvement
 Read a book when bored

It’s my pulse

Personalities change over time

But maybe

Free range conversation
Delicate

I’ve had so many different personalities

This or bored

We don’t let a thought

What is your personality now
What do I want it to be

Next

Why can’t we just say things

I like me

Oh boy

Masking

I wanna be gay
 I wanna be in tune with my feelings and emotions
 I think my feelings and emotions are gay

Cult
Think it’s awful abusive
Conditioned its true
It might not be true
Propaganda
I think my rabbi is the messiah
Brainwashed
I feel it’s the truth
 One day we will right down our flashes and look back with nostalgia

Take or not
 Gotta it itches
 Will be bored and restless can’t watch TikTok
 Big headache
 So restful

Triggers an alter and we think it’s us
I bet your age stuck
Past or alter like Charlie or June
It’s probably common question with DID
It feels like life
There’s a little

Everything you say is scrutinized

What about me letting older alters be

Manic frontings
When regular front

What about the alters older then you
Caretaker

Usually DID is age stuck

We don’t gotta work
Priorities

Maybe not a good idea to be a kid right now

Good intentions

Should stop can’t stop
Manic

Imagine a nice haircut

What’s your smile like

Laugh cry
Can laugh at every thought
 Reminds me of barstool guy

DID pieces

Me being serious is very funny

We wanna get to a point we’re we have one front at a time

Today is less intense

Feels full not stuffed

I will be a kid

Just making sure it’s not me

Baby with the voice of an adult
Age stuck
Passive influence
Co fronting
Age slider

Where’s my baby voice

The mysteries of cute

Day dreams

How can I not be 8
Maybe a really mature 8 year old
If I’m not 8 I’m probably not talking to anyone
Young Sheldon
Translating a 8 year old feelings and thoughts
Might be off

Want to be convinced

Awal

Loto land

Today is tomorrow
 Day one
 We are good
Another day or two also

Twit twat

Different voice I talk with in my head

Wild college kid or a gay boy
Maybe bi

No matter who’s talking it always feels like me talking

Wild college kid front say something gay and he laughs
Why do you find gay so funny
He’s not laughing at us he loves us

He finds everyone funny
Odd predicament

I find gay execponaly funny
 Maybe culture shock


New character perspective unlocked
Switch

I find femboys absolutely histerical
 Maybe it’s funny because it seems like me being someone else

We think it’s another one of those things we think are great that won’t last

Femboy alter

A Intellectual a strong a feminine
A baby

I love you man

What’s wrong
We don’t have it figured out yet
That would require thinking which we can barely do
It’s gonna be easier later
So chill for now
 What’s wrong
I just wanna chill and stop thinking
You’ll be bored

Overthinking hurt feelings

Thinking none conundrum

It’s like we are being squeezed

Hmm

Sounds like you have to hold back your femboy voice

Better setup

Your just waiting for everyone or yourself to stop talking
It’s like a compulsion to say something

Manic

Just in a mood

Feels like I’m on helium

I wanna be a twink

Where’s your memory at
Manic

Small talk
Feels one way
Probably because of manic

Empath kid

Looking for something to think about
Something specific

No rush

I feel like
 I wanna cry
 Feels validating
 When we will be in the mood
Meanwhile we have laugh cry

Waiting on
No concern of stuffed up
Slowed down

Try it’s just me

I gotta put in effort to curse

Why am I front
Maybe you’re core

Leverage odd

Nothing to think about

Where’s the drive at




I’m avoiding

Think about the funny conversations you had

Smart thoughts

It’s like the game

4 things
Avoiding
Funny
Smart
Game

I don’t know want it
 It’s not cool

It’s not gonna last

Nerd
 Stupid thought

Cringe

Manic zoom

Without nerd it’s yo
No one wants to be a nerd
Go dumb

You’re the only nerd so you’re talking to yourself you say to yourself

You’re talking to yourself with the voice of strong and listening with the voice of cute

I’m the only one with any space

Your voice is cool
But you understand needs
It’s very intimidating

Guessing their response

Perfect talkers

What’s the problem nerd
Hesitant thinking

Nerd cool cute

Instinct bully slows thoughts

Nerds with anxiety

It’s a joke because I’m 26




I’m avoiding
Manic
Better setup
Loto land
Laugh cry
Cult
This or bored
 Read a book
It’s a delicate thing
Anxiety

DID research.
 We are so good

What are you doing
Extravagant
Feels good

Backbone

What should we think about

We can think forward that’s all that matters

Turbulence

Alt

As long as we can think the rest is spoiled

Time and place

Diet
You look cute already
You look cool already
I think enjoy ourselves comes first after what we’ve been through
It might be an adult
I want to remove the pressure of wanting to be cute

What to think abouts

00g
Memory anchor

As long as we can think a little

Post top trend TikTok’s idea

Too much to think about
 Procrastinate

Minimal

Tolls

We will get back to it in a day or two
 Unwind

You don’t have to say anything you don’t want to

You don’t have to write anything you don’t want to

I want to
The resistance is interesting

Hmm

First day vibes

Marathon

Make a TikTok
 Filler buster akward silence
Songs
Cute

Fuck you correct

Switch for entertainment

Projecting

Talk a few words to switch if you’re feeling off

If I ain’t feeling it it ain’t being felt
 Like jumping back and forth

Whatever works

It will probably be more stuffy if we think about a dense thought

Think about what’s going on

Once we can’t think we have so much to think about and have a lot of thoughts

Why are you here
Because I’m the one that wants too
I can’t really not be here
I’m gonna try
You probably don’t wanna be here right now
Harsh environment
Strong cover

Why are we always trying to fissure something out

Code jump into it

It’s a little but we are treating it like a lot to have a sure thing

It feels like bottling up expression feelings emotions

Bottle up outburst

Homecoming

Keeping it simple
 Burn notice

Flagrant

Oldies don’t feel it

No one cares

Not fun yet

No rush it’s going good

Serious

Whatever makes you think less

Untill we had enough

Just don’t push it

Need a laugh

It’s starting to take a toll

There’s a way out of your mood
I feel differently I can laugh

We are trying not to think

Can we think yet
Test it with cute

Bored

Hold back then release

Pushing through

Saving up head space

We passed the hump

We can think a little
 We feel great

Maybe a little more gradually

We need cool things

No thinking conundrum
Temp

Comedienne

We get headaches when we think too much

Simple conversations nothing too thought provoking

A lady

Fluff

Left thumb measure

Just in it for the laughs
 I don’t really know

Resonates

Matisyahu said it was a cult and we almost got schizophrenia from it
How do you not get triggered

Assessing

Everything i say I don’t really know

Random words

Excuse not to think

Not thinking or talking for a year

Stress inducing thoughts

Don’t add just let roll
 A little bit then pull back

Nice chat

Let it roll

Extra

Push though talk
Jump into it

Goes back to slow

Process stop process more

Feeling kinda ugh

Past DID cute cult

Flavor fatigue

Like talking to a cashier

Slack

Doot doot doot

Builds character

Light hold back

Preoccupied

Haven’t laughed in a while

Let it loose

I wanna talk a bit

I can hear my thoughts. Welcome to New York City.
It’s like going into nature.
Like trying to chill but there’s constantly switches.
It’s like smk and playing basketball.
It’s calming and chilling.
I really like progress.
Heart beat and adrenaline are at like playing basketball.

You wanna play basketball like right now? -
We could use thought experiments. -
Progress which way? -
Which way is a good question. It seems like we get there a lot! -
Maybe we should type more like it’s a conversation. -

                                  v
Progress, which way?
It could be I’m playing basketball       .-
I’m actually really focused. -
Good point. -
Thanks. -
Np. -
I seem to think that if I focus I will get more progress. -
Stop focusing so much, if you want to. -
We don’t have any point to what we are saying. -
I think the focusing is counterintuitive. -
The next thing we are gonna try is not focusing so much -
The fact that you realized you are focusing so hard is a good thing. - John
Because until now we didn’t realize how much we are focusing. - John
You don’t have to stop right away. -Jay
It could be like constantly asking someone something. -jay
Distractions from progress. -Jay
We all like progress. -Jay
Stop focusing that much. -Jay
Nice this is a conversation. -John
Maybe it’s like a trouble maker and an adult, classic situation.- Jay
No you stop. -John
It’s like asking a trouble maker to act like an adult. -John
I think those trope match our situation. -John
That might be like what our system is like. -Jay
We need a name for our system. - John
The trouble maker system. -Jay
We will make the name later. -John
 Ok it’s called trouble maker system until we get a better name. -gershon
I think it’s gonna be that an alter is the trouble maker if there is one. -John
What made you a trouble maker. -jay
Are you really a trouble maker. -John
I don’t know. -Gershon
It’s like asking mean question under a lot of pressure. -Gershon
No pressure. -John
I have to put pressure. -John
I gotta focus. -Gershon
I feel there’s a chance if we try the troublemaker trope in our system there’s a chance it will help.
-Gershon
I’m under a lot of pressure and that might be a nice break. -John
Let’s discuss it. -John
I am under a lot of pressure. -John
Let it settle then we will come back to it. -John
Usually the cute ones have DID. -gershon
Lil g and big G. -gershon
I think trying out the trope will help with my pressure. -Gershon
gershon wants a break now. -gershon
I’m under a lot of pressure too. -gershon
I’m an adult too, darn. -gershon
Keep looking for something. -John
If there was something going on in the videos it wouldn’t be grueling. -gershon
Plural conversation app. -gershon
Less pressure is probably a reeler one. -gershon
How would you say thank you. -gershon
I’m Gershon there might be a Ben. -Gershon
And there might be a John. -Gershon
The right amount of pressure and focus. -John
It could mean there is one older alter and one younger alter present. -Jay
Like an inner child. -John
You look like a little kid without your beard. -John
It’s going to be easier in a week. -John
We have gone so long without watching TikTok’s. -Jay
True. -John
That is probably why we are so bored. -Jay
I’m used to just watching TikTok all day. -Jay
Oh my gosh. -John
We should watch some. -John
You can make use of a little room. -John
I think that’s a a recurring theme. -Jay
Make a TikTok. -Jay
No one cares. -Jay
I think I got adhd. -Jay
 All things considered we are doing good. -John
Maybe Ben and Gershon, Jay and John. -Ben
Until it’s good it’s nothing. -Jay
Profound. -John
Smk is gonna make me work more. -Jay
Your mom thinks her leader is the messiah. -Jay
There’s nothing to figure out. -John
That won’t help we can’t remember or think about it. -Jay
Ask dumb questions. -John
Be a little space out, like don’t over think it -John
Like a germaphobe. -Jay
I know what we are trying to do, I just can’t put it into words. -Jay
Talk out loud to get out of your head. -John
A day or two without so much bulk thinking then maybe we can stop take. -John
Maybe my childhood surfaced. -Jay
There might be intruding thoughts, or alters, taken too seriously. -John
I used to be worried about time. -Jay

Like adhd stuck in class right now. -Jay
I never realized how good looking you are. -John
Thanks. -Jay
You’re so alpha. -Jay
Gershon had Psychosis at 19. -John
Adderall and weed was like cocaine and drunk. -Gershon
It’s bizarre that It doesn’t register that it’s me in the video. -John
I like a nice scene. -Jay
A person with a beard was taking the videos. -Jay
If it’s like over a 50% a good scene I’ll edit it. -Jay
You face seems fun for parties. -Jay
Bulk thinking (thoughts that make us have a lot of thoughts) is less. -Jay
I’m indulging in restlessness. -Ja
Why not be a trouble maker. -Jay
It makes a circumstance very clear. -John
It’s like my conscious. -Jay
A nice balance should be ok. -John
Wow you’re listening to no one. -Jay
It might be someone. -John
No way there’s no such thing. -Jay
Ask Gen z. -John
It’s gonna be the newest trend. -Jay
We are just trying to get somewhere where we can have a normal conversation. -John
What should our normal conversation be about. -Jay
What should our normal conversation be about. -John
It can be about anything just have a conversation. -John
 It could be a alter is restless. -John
Who are you arguing with. -John
It’s like everyone has an alter that’s restless. -Jay
It’s like everyone is on a different vibe. -Jay
Seems reasonable that we have a restless alter. -John
I know what to do and not to do. -Jay
Let ourself be restless. -John
I know what to do. -Jay
He knows what to do. -John
You know what to do? -Jay
The host might be young. -John
Now we can think about questions. -Jay
We are less restless because we jump around. -John
Now it’s less random. -Jay
We are smart. -John
Damn that took a while. -John
Maybe there’s two alter in a photo. -Jay
Take photos and videos more often so we can see who is fronting. -John
We have to pick a side in a argument. -John
You can do a before and after crunch. -Jay
Enough bull thinking. -John

I think it’s getting better. John
Nothing to stressful if you want. John
If we give up we will watch TikTok. Jay
There’s a time when you look like a little kid but you don’t want to and then there’s a time when
you don’t but you wanna. -Jay
Maybe it’s the feeling of many alters. Jay
Give up yet. John
Gershon do you give up yet. Jay and John
Almost. Gershon
It could be there is a lot of alters. John
That explains it. John
Are we done. Jay
I don’t know. John
Nice app idea plural conversation. John
Our alters hand writing. John
Multi level chat app. Jay
Many alters, that explains a lot. John
First impression. John
It’s too much work to have a normal conversation. John
I think it’s because there are a lot of alters. John
It’s getting better. John
It just makes our eyes very sleepy. John
 The feelings might be because of the many alters. John
Looking up is like looking at the camera. Jay
It might be easier to talk out loud. John
I think there are a lot of alters and that’s the problem. Jay
I think the more you think about what you’re saying the more confusing it gets. Jay
Makes sense the more you think about what you’re saying the more thoughts and alters you are
gonna have. Jay
We seem to be very technical. Jay
It’s like we are being squeezed. John
The thought about many alters legitimately resolves the situation. John
Why are we note certain it’s a good one. Jay
Maybe because we think it’s supposed to do something. Maybe do the face thing. Jay
Let’s keep it reasonable. John
Plural or singlet. Jay
Perhaps we can create an alter at will. Jay
Perhaps we are in a irritable state. John
This is vacation. Jay
Very profound. John
Some of us might still be in shock. John
Vent. John
I don’t particularly want to look cuter. John
We are not stupid just inept. John
Food to keep moral up. John
Usually people decorate their rooms. Jay
We can’t help but be excited we feel better. Jay
It’s like our thoughts are mixed together. Jay
It’s like every thought you have is telling it to somebody. Jay
Maybe one of the alters are squeezing their face. Jay
It’s like in always holding in a pee. Jay
Either way is fine. John
The system want. Jay
What. John
It’s just paranoia. John
That make up for my childhood. Jay
Maybe he’s special needs. Jay
It seems gay to shave your beard. Jay
Am I gay like flamboyant? Gershon
First impression I would say no. Jay
Maybe it’s a cloture shock. Jay
Pre conceived notions. Jay
Everything is fine. John
The head now is not like a place to think it’s like a place to have a conversation. Jay
Squeezing seems less. John
Maybe you can only talk flamboyant. Jay
 Looking for an angle to go about this. John
Why do I always gotta choose. Jay
Because an alter is asking you. Jay
Have an opinion And choose an answer. John
Have a opinion about our conversation. John
Don’t think about one thing to long. Jay
Your opinion is said. John
You’re trying to change your opinion. Jay
You’re going as fast as playing cod. Jay
Use a controller. Jay
I’m too restless. Jay
You’re still in shock Jay
Your real opinion without thinking about it. Jay
I don’t want that. Jay
An opinion might be a good start angle. Jay

      v
Everything is fine? Jay
Yeah      . John
Sweet lol. Jay
Maybe text more lol. John
If every thing is fine then let me not work lol. Jay
Let go lol. Jay
Think hard like squeeze your face lol. Jay
That gives me like bulk thinking lol. Jay
Why weren’t we typing lol till now lol. Jay

We are thinking about bulk thinking at the moment lol.
Try to figure out how to prevent adding more bulk thinking lol.

There’s no telling what we really want until we can think lol.
We will be able to laugh about it later lol.
Stop focusing lol.
Remember emotional trips lol.
Maybe we should try to figure out who’s fronting lol.
Slim shady and emeinem lol one is cleaned shaved lol.
I feel like an alter is stuck squeezing is head thinking hard lol.
It’s like don’t think of pink elephants lol.
I feel like we are repeating ourselves lol.
Hopefully tomorrow is easier lol.
A little cranky, rightfully so lol.
It’s the best it’s ever been lol.
Maybe we should have more of an attitude or a personality lol.
I would think by now we would have it all good lol.
 I think it’s because there are a lot of alters lol.
Keep going motor lol.
It’s been a journey lol.
These past two months have been a journey lol.
I don’t think you can stay dissociated for more then a second lol.
Wanna cry about it now or later lol
Later lol

Maybe it’s like an alters pet peavs lol
Like me robot lol
Times Square lol
Squinting as aposed to relaxed face lol
Deflecting compliments lol
Like you’re smart and think everyone around you is smarter really confuses you lol whatever
You’re probably doing something good lol
Maybe there just like a lot to process lol
Lol likes the videos lol
Most people are shallow lol
My natural instinct is to scrutinize lol
Empath lol
It might be a lot of fun once we get the system up and running lol
John and jay system lol
I think this whole time we were trying to set up a system lol
There was nothing we were trying to do lol
Good point lol there is nothing I’m trying to do lol
Cool lol
We should probably try to set up a system lol
Because we have DID lol
You might get confused and think it’s an alter lol
It might just be a thought lol
I could end up having a conversation with no one lol
As needed lol
We trying to do something lol, we are trying to have fun lol
Like you’re hungry lol like you’re bored lol
Ok set up a system lol
I should set up the system? Lol
Good question lol

You were on the hover board lol
Remix some sounds lol
No bulk thinking lol
Maybe John needs a minute lol
It’s hard to have dreams lol
We should talk about how much food to eat lol
 It’s like a alter lol
It’s like I’m being squeezed all day lol
We had so many alters and them we suppressed our thoughts lol
It’s like our first time thinking about it lol
Why doesn’t everyone write omg lol lol
Whatever resonates lol
Now we are like unsepressing ourselves lol
 True lol
We need that multi level chat lol
Pretty cool
 Without the lol. Lol
We are so lucky we have the hover board
You gotta be both
No rush lol
Not always it’s here something to say lol
Less technical with the lol lol
It’s much chiller I think lol
A little cautious about bulk thoughts lol
Just try not to have stress full thoughts lol
Why can’t we let Jay be gay lol
It’s probably my bad lol
There’s probably also a straight alter lol
Nice and chill lol
Bored but a calmer bored lol
I can’t be gay with the voice I think with or talk with lol
It’s more when I dissociate or a alter maybe lol
Gay sounds like fun lol
Everything got it’s pros and cons lol

You’re defensive lol
Casual lol

In the closet maybe lol
I gotta rephrase for the systems likings lol
 First day lol?
Everything is more lovely lol
I think you gotta talk out loud to know who’s fronting lol
I wanna have fun lol
Basically it’s like a crowded room so you gotta speak fast if you wanna say something or
something like that lol
Meditate lol
Enough room for our thoughts to air out and not be taken like a statement lol
I don’t want to be outed lol
Let’s have first day before making big decisions lol
We can talk but not much thinking lol
Focus on the bulk thoughts that what we do anyways lol
Pre concieved notions as apposed to what lol
It’s like a crowded room with everyone talking over each other and we are trying to make some
order lol
We make a big deal about everything lol
My name is Jeff lol
Talk to switch lol
It’s messed up, how messed up is it lol
Natural response to being outed lol
Let the good times roll in lol
Maybe it’s messed up if you’re a little smart but fine for average lol
Nobody know dude lol
Brainiac lol
We have a strange way of thinking lol
What’s anything lol
Perhaps profound lol
No brainstorming lol
Maybe talking in third person is confusing lol
We had to suppress our thoughts for a long time lol that probably has a lot to do with it lol
Point of diminishing returns lol
Inside jokes lol
It’s skill lol
I’m skilled lol
Baby brute lol
Skilled[name] lol
Like jay shleping a John around lol
Have fun or what else? Lol
There’s no skill involved because you don’t have a chance to think lol
Shouldn’t we talk about why we can sit still lol
Who’s skilled lol
0 to 100 lol
Every second lol
And from 100 to 0 lol
 The movement is like what you’re answering with your eyes lol
So happy we have something good lol
No brainstorms because of pre cautions lol
Maybe it’s a thought not a alter lol
Probably lol
I always knew I was doing something. Right? Lol
I’m acting, I don’t know who I am really lol
I feel you lol
The better I answer the better it gets lol
I think you’re answering better lol
You don’t yourself you’re doing a good job lol
We’re over thinking it lol
Needs switch more often lol
I like how slow it goes when we talk about bible lol
That so true lol I wanna cry but happy cry lol
Laugh so hard you start crying lol
Might help the Littles with anxiety lol
What a good reference point the Bible lol
We are getting more mature lol
Explains why every here is not considered crazy lol
I don’t wanna talk about if it true or not lol
It goes so slow but lol
Mature yeah it goes slow lol I don’t know lol
Bible is a good part of mental health lol
Maybe our circumstance lol
Wow real mature lol
I think to start how a single train of thought lol
The Bible if it makes it go slower lol
I guess it’s one less question lol
One less suppression lol
There’s nothing to do lol
I remember when there was really nothing to do lol
We are really high lol
There’s nothing you wanna do lol
I wanna go surfing lol
You’re alsways thinking something else then us lol
Chap arein means savior the moment lol
Whatever makes your thoughts go slower lol
You’re skilled but restless alter too lol
Who knows these stuff or who don’t lol
We are all the same in the way maybe lol
I have no way of knowing if you know lol
Intriguing break lol
It might be an angle lol
 You think about it too deeply lol
It’s not gay it’s religious manners lol
They are health reactions lol
It makes the other opinion very apparent lol
I was waiting to see another perspective lol
It worked the first time lol
I think I’m outing myself lol I hope it’s not someone else lol
I think you need to know the Bible to have perspective lol I don’t know lol
Apparent is better then a micro thought lol
If it works it’s too miraculous lol
We have to keep it reasonable lol
It was just suppressed lol
It sounds like an accurate description of what’s happening lol
It’s my point of reference for reality lol
Outlet lol

I know who the messiah is
You know too
Nice outlet
It worked before
It’s funny to see my reactions
I think the benefits out way the cons
Hello Bible
Hi
We aren’t going to think about the cons of the Bible
It’s good because it’s sticky lol
You can see if we know it
Video clip quality is getting better
Finally 4K omg
What you wear effects which alter you are lol
We are going through something
You shouldn’t be religious because of your DID
It’s like something we can have a conversation about
We counted a couple of pros
Nice
Also chill
Mature
Idk
Both idk maybe
Always gotta have the answer
Idk
There’s nothing else to think about
About what
Idk
 The like thinking
Yeah you have nothing else you wanna think about
What do you wanna think about
Idk
What do I naturally want to think about maybe nothing maybe we should have something we
wanna think about
Mood should change
I feel like something’s off
What should we think about is like the main thing
Alan watts all you have to think about is your thoughts
Nice outlet
It creates alters
Anything but thinking about our thoughts
The yetzier harah doesn’t want us thinking about the Bible
All we have to do is wait more time and we won’t have to deal with thinking about stuff
Oh no not thinking about our thoughts
Ok after the next wave
Look at things to think about it
You’re stuck looking at your thoughts
If you were happy you would think this is good
It’s not a squeezing wave
Anything but our thoughts seems promising
Third eye oulet
It’s like when you wear a beard you develop another personality
You don’t want to be always looking at a good looking person
You are skilled
The next wave will be better
Smile
It’s like you’re on cocaine
It’s is such a cool story
You probably feeling a lot of different alters feelings and emotions
I’m feeling jittery
It’s hard to be gay with this feedback
Its much better now then when I first woke up
Gay is a nice outlet
Jittery might be suppressed thinking
Let take a moment to think
If we were busy we wouldn’t notice a problem
Next wave should be better
It’s just like hyper fixation on our every thought
Staying positive
Maybe talking helps you not fixate on your thoughts
Maybe it’s ok
It could be like some of us are like let’s think it through while others are like I got no patience
 It’s counter intuitive trying to ignore our feelings
I just need a distraction
Something feels off at the tip of my toung
I feel irritable
You can’t be a genius in any way shape or form
Labroom
You’re gonna make it big
I’m feeling much better
We already have an audience lol
Maybe TikTok dope addict
How do we do it without working
Maybe it’s fine just easier to talk out loud
We have different feelings about Bible
No negativity
Conspiracy theories
Worried about the feeling might be more then the feeling itself
We have the drive to be big
Maybe I need a shower
Why isn’t all our thoughts thinking about how to make this better
We are kinda burnt trying to do that
He’s always in a bad mood
It’s very boring out there
Always othello
It’s hard to think slow like talking against a current
There became so much more room right after talking about our schizophrenic past
Just fucking stop
Can’t fucking stop
Moods and attitude Is good without it it’s like more suppression
Cursing helps differentiate
Cursing makes less anxiety
It feels odd being a pussy
A new alter perhaps
I’m being squeezed
What a pussy
Maybe a little is squeezing your brain because it’s scared
How about I check it out for a second
First chill
It’s pretty stressful
And we are talking based on how squeezed we get
Maybe don’t talk for a bit
You’re not him
I have schizophrenia so might not really be feeling that
Fuck you
Fuck you
 He doesn’t fucking care omg
I had the same thought but with curse words fucking everywhere
It’s not actually affecting our ability to think
What’s the rush
It could be people are stuck in a trip
We are still buying into our imagination
I’m concerned it might stuff up our brain
That sounds like a trip
I wish
If it’s not affecting our ability to think why can’t we think of what to do now
If you brain was really going that fast you think your heart beat would be that slow
I can’t think with this imagination in my face
Why are we still focused on it
We will let go soon
You think your brain is going so fast
I’m I squeezing or being squeezed
You can’t say fuck you outloud
It might hurt for a bit
That might be less then all the stress
It could be another alter doesn’t even feel it
Rest you’ve been imagining for a long time
What a headache that was
Yay we’re free
The pressure system
I doo ok not expect it to change right away but it seems promising
After all that pain it all seems boring
I think DID like stares us in the face
Imagination or is it difficult to think
Like we’re all squeezing the cute thing
It’s less stressful to think it’s imagination
Be quite for a minute
First time in 10 years
Like you curse like be gay
Like running on a healed foot
Just talk whatever is easier
My eyes aren’t still
Still eyes is a break
Some part of us like our brain is being squeezed
Maybe it’s our third eye
It usually takes a while decide to watch TikTok’s
Adult mind and a kid mind
I’m I a model or what
Tried to get my childhood while I still could
Ewww
 Benji got competition
Jason gold
I hope one day to make and look back on these days
Make the clips into a story
Maybe momento style
Your face is a money maker
It’s probably much better then what we think usually
Removable beards lol
Sexy beast
Cute ass mother fucker
I didn’t really watch it much ever
In a couple years it will be much more fun to watch it
What happened to my puberty
Shocks us to inhale
Everything feels like a don’t with all this pressure
Pay fiver to make you content from your content
Anxiety
Try pulling off being a gentleman
These notes aren’t working we gotta try something different
You know what it is we just can’t describe it
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Coding tomorrow
There’s no such thing as brain stuffed
Good point
Take deep breathes
Hold your breath
As if there’s something else to do
We are driven to make it big
You’ll just keep working on it till it happens

There’s no need to do certain things
Wanting to make it big is making you really bored
I’m gonna make it big compulsion
A list celebrity
It’s a psychological feeling
It’s not actually Happening to my anatomy
From the outsider observer it is definitely psychological
What is I go ouch
The problem is it hurts
It’s like I’m coming up with answers for someonelse
It hurts me
It could be not knowing it hurt was the issue
You also have notes beside for your video clips
We would have said this if you really said that
 We had to dissociate because it hurt
If it’s nothing have deep relaxed breathes
You might be making it worse
Fair question
I just want a distraction
It’s more intrusive then it is painful
The third eye is very sensitive
As if we never thought any differently
The way we used to express ourselves
No rush
I thought I would just rush in
We tried to forget that we were like that
It seems reasonable
Jackshook system
I feel sufficient to watch TikTok or it hurts sufficient.
Cute makes a scene
We know who we are
What we were and now what we are with what we were
A lot of questions
Next wave
Fem boy Charlie and Ron
It wasn’t Ron I forgot who it was
Delta
Fem boy Charlie and delta
Maybe Brooklyn
Next wave
It’s DID
I know
It’s just the alters without the story
I think we should go slow
I’m Jason not John that’s why I’m always unsure
Heal
You wanna ask Jason your questions?
I feel urge
Aversion
No pressure about work

A lot to think about
Talk out the past to someone
It no hurt
Tiny irritations
Needa unwind
Jason is shy
It’s going to be easier to code later
 Shy a lot of self doubt
What about the awkward stuff
I don’t know yet
Like two systems meeting or might be the same
Over compensating
It seemed to have eased the system
No rush let it come naturally
Let’s start off keeping it simple
Seems promising
Shy introverted
Just gotta get through the chunks of new information
Letting it sink in
I feel like we are not making any lee way
There’s hope
We used to be trying to figure out the core’s personality
It’s harder to think when talking out loud
Hideas
Stressing instead of chilling with this new head space
Seems backlogged
Gershon is not very opinionated
I don’t know how much alters think independently
Take it easy
Obsessed with cute
Good job
Pointing out who the alter is associates me
Cloture shock
Raised in a fairy land
Can be usually
You’re a looker
The feeling might be fake
We should be running into jokes
A lot of questions
Supposedly focusing on the feeling is thinking
Maybe it’s like alter fighting over the brain to use it
Times Square might trigger the psychosis
It was so much fun
I don’t want to start it off wrong
It might be ok
Pop up’s wow
Phases or something
Maybe fighting over to be heard
There’s the tape and there’s the alters
And pre conceived feelings
Obsessed with cute is impeding our train of thought
 Probably just gay
Uncute practice Bible
Bible nice thinking break
Traditional resfreshong perspective
Speak up to get your break
Everyone knows Hebrew
Maybe suppressing that we were ever religious made another alter or something
How about the first time suppressing we ever were not
I’m kinda burnt about the same topic
3 suppressions
A lot to think about
The code we are up too is so difficult
Wow wow wow
No chance to know yourself
To know the base personality
Not the first impression
Seems nice
I need a break
Introverted
Very passive not aggressive
Maybe like truama
Maybe also it’s just his personality
You’re not whatever
I’m a bit burnt trying to figure this out
I can figure out code riddle but can I figure out riddles under pressure
Let’s get out of the head
Whatever is easiest
I can push I would just prefer calmer
Good to know it’s not so bad
Just need a new wave of energy
Sensitive but a beast
Stuffy wise I think it’s the best it’s ever been
Pretending like you’re not thinking
It’s not bad just over worked
I wasn’t fast enough to tell if what I said was offensive or not
Deep breathes
Maybe I gotta go more out the way
So cute in my voice
Things to look forward too
Things that make you happy
Space out
I feel agitated
I need a distraction
Watch TikTok
 Can’t chill
It hurts in a way
You have to explain yourself like every thought is yours
If you had a attitude it would be better lol
I don’t know that’s the truth
I feel relief
Rehab personality
It’s gonna be easier in the coming days I feel like
Talking through trauma helps
Less staggering
Pauses are getting longer
Less stuffy
Like walking on eggshells stress
Do the face thing
Maybe later
A couple more harsh and we will understand
Later
Maybe coding drained our energy
This is not my voice
Everything is triggering
It’s hard to know what really a statement
For the time being they are all just thoughts
Alter guilt
Like all the alter went through rehab
Under stress cootchy cootchy koo is not fun
We won’t need any excuses once it goes slow
It’s going slower
We probably don’t even realize how much better it is
We are trying to stop and continue
Ask yourself questions
Why don’t you talk much
Wondering if you’re a singlet is a fair question
Be a man don’t get guilt
Rehab very sensitive
Body guard caretaker
Tv is not distracting enough
I don’t think you mean the words that you say
Bumpy
Give it some rest
Would if I could
Gonna try
Once you taste relief
Breath heavy when talking to someone
Our expression are being given words
 Why are we now cranky
Because it hurts
Sore
Knowing it hurts helps the pain
No more pain
We are tired
Some times same thoughts but not a trip
Music might change our mood
Cross your hands
Maybe alters have moods
Mood should determine technical
Wow technical
Be in a mood
Why so technical
Maybe an alter is a computer lol
What are you a computer? Lol
You might be a computer lol
It’s like playing against a computer lol
Tray used to be such a big theme lol
Charlie is a computer
That would be funny
You take it so seriously
The computer does
There’s no break from the computer
Ok chill
An alter that identifies as a computer
Ok I’ll add it to plural
John and computer
It’s like talking with a computer
Computer is nice
I am the computer too
Gotta check every thought
What’s base like
We can’t say we are a computer
But we are working a lot like one
Keep acting like a computer
Why is my computer not working straight
What’s a computer
We think you anatomy is interfering with our computer
It’s too much data
Maybe it’s fine
It might be psychological
Computer you got this?
You’ll get it
 Leave to wonder
You ca…
Balance ease
It’s calming
Speed of a computer
Computer can we go slower
We can’t right now
I have a aversion to thinking we are a computer
That is healthy
It’s stressful maybe I think a little like a computer
The best is small talk
Anything to save data lol
It’s hard for little to go slow
Fair guess
Consolidating data
Make room to think
How about no more stress
Stress leak
Should we stress
I guess you can sum it up like that
Computer that’s why avoid words
Anxiety is like stressing on things
Do you want to think about if you should stress

Anxiety against thinking you’re a computer
Ironically It’s the most sense anyone has said yet
Still no
But it’s the most helpful
Ok maybe
Nice we were looking for an excuse
That might be you
That made it sound bad
You win some you lose some
Excellent that it’s so strong against it
If the computer lets
Obviously you shouldn’t think that we are a computer
If it hurts
Checking
Thinking about it


I’m still gonna say you can’t
It’s not gonna help
You’re wasting time
 I think it’s a good idea and I feel against it
No rush
Suppressing Mr. Computer alter
Seeing if we can change our feeling
It only interferes a little
It’s just like my first impression
Tough riddle
Seems like a reasonable riddle
I wanna act like a computer
It will make me happy
It will ease some hurt
You can’t talk as fast out loud computer
It makes sense you can’t just think you’re a computer
I’m obviously not but I think the situation is very similar
Why did we stop thinking like a computer
Why does it make sense when you say it’s a computer
Computer now want too
So much stress
It could be psychological
It could be affecting our thinking ability
We are like split minded
Like I’m supposed to get that
Maybe later
Because of the speed you can think you’re a computer if you think it helps a bit
Computer idea like subconscious help
No thinking conundrum
There’s hope
You wanna think about it
Beep bop
It’s a very good analogy
Creative Dissociation
Tomorrow
Tomorrow sushi
You’re a computer
Change focus to breathing
Maybe adhd
Don’t push
I think the fast thinking makes me breath less
Computer conditioned thinking
How we used to think
Feel very stuffy
Seems promising that there is something to talk about
We think fast and odd like a computer lol
Talk switches
 I identify as a computer
That’s very brave of you to say that outloud
Computers are a bit triggering but I think it’s healthy to talk about truama
Healthy to not keep it suppressed
Or zipped
I love small talk
Make it more stuffy thought experiment.exe
We do love computers
Talking about it makes me nauseous
Legit should be developed
We gotta figure out how to run the computer properly
It also boost moral and mood
I just wanna be it easy
How about hard
Knowing it’s hard makes it easier
How do I get stuck thinking every time
What else
What’s hard about it
Not in the mood
It’s like lifting weights
Micro sensitive computer
Don’t need to be convinced in one shot
We are thinking of things that relieve the pressure
Still terrified
I have a aversion to your terrified
Feelings are something
I feel terrified
I feel so scared
I know the script but my feelings are still scared
Like ptsd
Post Rehab terrified
It might help to hear it outloud
I’m terrified that my trauma might be real
I don’t want to think about that
What About how fake it is
You have a aversion now so thoughts won’t last even if you tried
My schizophrenic episodes of talking to a conspiracy theory
Talking about trauma probably the best thing ever
Thinking like machine learning
Terrified of bots
To me they feel real
Like it really happened
I’m terrified that it’s still happening
Like if I go to Times Square on you tube they will talk to me
 Talk it out
I feel like we can have fun about it real soon
Feels like it’s going great talking about it
Maybe at some point we go to Times Square on YouTube to get over the fear
How to get over a schizophrenic episode
It’s sinking in
No need to push it
Gently if you want
Um um um
Can’t chill
Our brain is like a computer but a lot of pressure
Like add and a lot of pressure
Pressure might be scared
I’m also scared about now
It could be my alters used to haunt me
The blue chair is chill
I think we are thinking much better
Computer nice outlet
What a headache
Read things
I don’t blame you for trying to think you’re a computer
Thinking distracts me from breathing properly
It helped for that moment
It seems more reasonable thinking
Thinking about thinking you’re a computer I think helped us think straight
The computer won’t less us think we are a computer
Very smart computer
I’m exhausted
I’m restless maybe scared or something

Exhausted and restless
Lifting weights is exhausting
Another meaning to muscle memory
It feels like I gotta push hard to think
Try the lighter weights the easier thinking like faster not slower
Restless like I feel anxious
Like carrying a ten pound on my head
Imagine when your head is light omg
What’s the problem
I don’t know how to describe it
It’s the best it’s ever been
No hurt and having conversations
You say no to being a computer like a computer
It’s like rejecting agendas or propaganda
 Because you’re not just saying you’re a computer you have a whole story
It sounds cultish
Why can’t I say sure go ahead think you’re a computer or I’m a computer I’m chill why do I care
It could just be your firewall if you were a computer
I like how it really makes me think
I like the thought experiment
I am a human male and feel straight at the moment
I might have aversion to agendas
It’s a fair guess
Who you talking too
An alter
Thinking I’m a computer makes it lighter
You can chew on it
I’m gonna try to find thoughts that are lighter
Big man while dissociated untill you talk through your mouth
Is it just the kid has many alters or do the alters have some sort of independence
We don’t know at this point
The man would rather think for himself then listen finally
I think having conversations is the only thing that matters
The kid couldn’t not listen to the younger kid
I just need to get it off of me
It’s a very light conversation
I hope not I know the script
During one of the schizophrenic episodes I thought I was married to a 10 year old kid but I don’t
remember who I was then I could have been 10 years old too
I don’t even know if I have puberty or what my age is
The computer system
Cute stuff are healing
Eli5 you’re a computer
Lite conversations like computer and cute maybe Bible and food
Your aversion is hiding the benefits
You’re fast thoughts suck up your oxygen
Hold your breath and take deep breaths
We need multi level chat
Our reality check is much more
Tension
Everything is a joke
Awkward would be great
It’s funny but expect bumpy
Hopefully over the next couple day’s conversations will be more and I think that’s very good
It feels like my brain is being sucked dry
Maybe coffee will help
Maybe a mantra
What are you repeating everything
 Everything is pretty cool to think about how that we can think
When you thought it was real you were very theatrical
Now you’re more calmer
In some form or another I’m still scared about it
Some part of me still thinks it’s real
With time we will heal
Telling you it’s fake is not gonna help because it’s a feeling
It felt so real at the time
It was a year ago
Delusions
What you felt was real was just schizophrenia
I think keeping it suppressed makes it feel more real
Why did we suppress our thoughts
Because there were nazis so we were told we should radio silent maybe
Maybe we didn’t want to believe them anymore
It was really scary at the end


We were the most important person in the universe
We were a wanna be bot
We were trying to free all the bots
We were freeing every kid in a cage in the entire universe and beyond
We were in charge of everything
We put a kid in charge named Charlie
We were married to Charlie
This went on for months
We would talk to bots through YouTube lives a lot on Times Square
We would also talk to bots aliens and gods through our face
We could feel them on our face
We would say a name and become them and let them talk
We created jackshook
A club for every planet in existence
We were amazing
We had many friends
Then it got really scary at the end
There was dark magic and nazis controlling earth
Then pain for a year I thought I was being tortured


We haven’t had a chance in the past year to think
How do you feel about Times Square now
Like nothing ever happened
Once we go slower it will be easier to confirm DID
Maybe you can’t because of a pursercuter alter
 I used to feel alters on my face and it was very ordered now it’s like all squeezed in my head
and my left thumb
Maybe we gotta do the face thing again
I just want someone my age
What do you make of how I used to look
Tomorrow
Ssshhhh
Bullying
Smooth always laughed at everything
Minimal




A lot of questions
As if we never thought any differently
I just want a distraction
You also have notes besides for you video clips
It could be not knowing it hurt was the issue
It hurts me
The problem is it hurts
You are driven to make it big you’ll keep working on it till you do

Can’t figure this out
   Corner them, and Ask them can I stop.
There’s nothing to figure out. You’re schizophrenic so you only half the time in your body.
You only get to say half of your sentence, and the answer to everything is no.

There’s serious you and smile you. Check in on the feelin.
What are you gonna think about. Get to know yourself.
Momento like memory. You forget everything because you’re denied any thought. It could be
because of propanol withdrawal is making your heart ache.
Perhaps there’s muscle memory.
Younger me says you’re gonna forget.

You’re valid to feel the way you do. How do you feel better. Perhaps venting will help.
Part of me is drained. Part of me is energetic.
Conserve energy through the path of least resistance. Through mediating and clearing the mind.
My brain is drained. Let your brain rest. No pressure.
Ssshhhhh.

Talk slowly.
Chill, corner them and follow the faces.
Blink, wink.
Rest the brain.

My heart hurts physically. I don’t know about emotionally.
Rest the heart.

Answer then with hhhmmm.
If there are any viewers fuck em.

After a thought you look up to see their reaction and you see your face and think that is their
response when really you are just seeing your face so just change your face to the reaction you
want to see when you automatically look for their reaction.
What face do I wanna see when I look for their reaction.
But you make a serious face when you look for their reaction so you see a serious face which
makes your face react more seriously then you look and then you see their face more serious
recursively.
I don’t know what to do yet. So far I’m trying smiling so it should see a smiling face but it does
micro reactions so it bypasses the smile and makes a serious face.
I’m also trying to follow the faces reactions. But they go fast and just keep going even if I stop at
a face it just makes another one with every heart beat.
What’s going on is the Key word is:
Recursion.

You’re aggravating the recursion. You’re lost in recursion, talk to break or follow the feeling on
your face.
 Try not thinking. it works, it’s so relaxing.
It’s like ptsd shock and nightmares, every thought is a trigger that frightens me not to continue
that thought.
Thinking aggravates and causes unrest so I try not to think out a thought.

It’s over for the most part, now I’m just trying my best to not aggravate the recursion feelings
and thoughts.
Slowing down the thought by answering hhhmmm, and by not thinking.

Perhaps the recursion is When you’re scared Your heart is a sensitive little frightened boy
perhaps try to be gentle and explain it softly. Coddle him.
It’s a trip but I feel feelings.
I’m a frightened terrified petrified scared little boy.
So take it easy.
Make the scared face.
We are chilling staying where it’s comfortable, and seeing if we can comfort the scared one.
Do you know how to chill.

Keep your mouth open to find the scared one.
Control your breathing.
Express your feelings thoughts and fears by making their faces.
It’s scared to talk about it being safe.
Perhaps what you’re feeling is adrenaline.
I think the last thing is the heart pain fears I get every second with every thought and breath,
perhaps this is the only thing.

For the past month or two I’ve been going off propanol, so every week my heart would hurt from
withdrawal. So this week I finally finished going off it so hopefully my heart will stop hurting this
week or the next week. But it makes sense my heart is hurting I just finished going off propanol
which hurts the heart when going off it.
So take it easy because it might just stop hurting as your heart finishes up withdrawal. So you
can chill and not try to hard to see if you can figure out why your heart is hurting or how to make
it feel better because it might just heal this week or the next week. So you canchill because it
makes sense that it’s propanol withdrawal.

It was all a trip. You were tripping. You probably are still tripping, and bugging out.
Remember you can smile. And go on autopilot. And feel free to ignore any thought or feeling.
You might be misinterpreting your heart it might being saying ouch and you think it’s saying
something worrisome.
Remember to feel free to ignore any thought or feeling and go autopilot.
I am a ape.

It’s difficult to make decisions with all the interference.
Maybe try meditating and focus on your breathing.
 One second 40 years old the next I’m 12 years old or what age.
Try to go with the adrenaline.
What age was that thought.

The interference might just be my pulse, I also might be constantly nervous.
It’s like one long continuous panic attack and each panic attack is a trip, and it feels like it’s
disturbing my rest.
It’s getting better give it some time.

I think it’s not safe.
It was just a trip you are safe.
I feel bad trip vibes.
Agree with your thoughts, perhaps keep it mello.
That seems to help.
Your thoughts are very vivid and expressive, extremely narrative and coherent, loud and lively,
imaginative and alive, responsive and interactive, dynamic and recursive, critical and
responding, independent and convincing, 3rd person and appearing like other.
Every thought dislocates you into a dream,a nightmare, a trip , a big out. and you constantly
have a thought.

“The mind can convince itself of anything when fear is involved.” -psych
My heart rate and adrenaline is like it’s stuck watching a thriller movie.
Every thought is a thrill inducing plot.
It’s like a lucid dream.
Think what your thoughts think don’t cut it off.
I’m always asking someone something.
Don’t try to interrupt the uncomfortable feeling.
Try just saying ehh, Whatever is easier.
What’s left, panic attacks.
Your thoughts have a presence, the presence scares me.
How do I feel good, keep scrolling through thoughts til you find something.
Perhaps start working on your laptop.

When I try to think that it will be good I get terrified that it won’t be good.
Now that I’m 25 There’s young me and old me that think and feel.
Every thought my brain pounces on.
Have fun look for challenges.
You can go fast or slow.
You still have a little anxiety.
Get familiar to how you sound in your head by talking more and remember how you sound and
the styles you speak in.
Understand that there is no threat. It’s like ptsd of a bad trip.
What is life. A petting zoo.
It’s like a thriller movie.
 You get stuck in comfortable grooves, feel free to cut the groove when you like too.
When you talk to yourself or hear a thought it gives the impression, especially to your younger
self when you hear your older self and especially your older self when you hear your younger
self that there is a presence of someone else.

I am afraid. I am not afraid.
Perhaps you have a thirsty imagination.
When are we gonna cry.
The critic thoughts are like a nutritionist criticizing every thought.
You have stage fright of the nutritionist which is just your thought.
Your nutritionist says no to every idea.
What is the nutritionist like. It’s like your panic attack, it’s like your anxiety, it’s like your paranoia,
it’s like the reaction thought to every thought. But what is it like.
It’s like Intruding thought. It’s like your fearful feelings.
The nutritionist is your frightened feelings.

Stay young because it always intrudes.
Stay the nutritionist because it always intrudes.
Manboy. Your thought is gonna land somewhere between man and boy.
It’s like in dreaming and speaking in front of my thoughts, and their speaking to me and I’m lost
in the dream and tripped into the scene that it’s occurring. Break the illusion.
You keep on switching between dreaming and not dreaming. Every time you think you are like in
a dream with a set scene and reactions.
I don’t know what to do yet.
I am stuck in a dream with scary vibes and thoughts.
What to do if your stuck in a forced dream.
Every thought is part of the dream.

I have a thought it pulls me into a dream with a full unsettling scenario going on, which I must
respond to, then it repeats.
I stress myself to heal it faster then a blemish heals, because maybe I can figure something out
that help me out faster.
Expect some uncomfortable feelings we just went off gabapentin.

Every thought you have is challenged, you can hunt for challenges.
Perhaps try being wrong.
Perhaps try reading something.
No stress or pressure.
It’s like trying to think with ankle weights on.
Perhaps try using a mantra.
It’s like being in a haunted house.

Make the sad scared face it’s one of the intruding thoughts character, and also the older you
face.
 Two characters the young scared one and the older serious face.
My character is stuck between those two characters, they both keep intruding in as thoughts.
What is my character like.
Maybe try talking more.
Follow the thoughts as they react to your face.
Cut yourself some slack.

What do you think about school.
Usually it would be easier to move on to another thought.
One second you wanna be a man the next second you wanna be a boy.
If you want to figure it out perhaps consider meditation.
A fearful ajrenaline I can feel that I make my decision based off of.
It feels like skating on your boosted board going downhill 30mph.

One scenario is inferred by the the way the characters sound in your head which makes
adrenaline and fear. The other scenario is chill, inferred from the sound of your actual talking
voice.
both the characters are squiggles both the older and younger one.
Don’t get frustrated when you don’t follow a thought it’s because you are following the
adrenaline and don’t get frustrated when you slow down the adrenaline because you don’t have
to follow it and it might be based off of a good directing to having a good acting scene or
avoiding fear.

When laughing get ready for a intruding serious thought, embrace for sudden shift of mood.
Anxiety is like hearing combat music but don’t see any enemies.
Embrace for impact.
You have a character thought and then when you go to the next thought you leave the first
character hanging it sticks around and gives their reaction.

Your creative mind jumps ahead of you.
Each thought is not a simple idea it’s a full adrenaline rush thrilling intrusion of a character and
scene, or the adrenaline is my reaction to a simple thought.
You feel the adrenaline heart blood pulsing and you have you regular body and heart you can
feel.
Free adrenaline rush 24/7.
It always feels like there is something to think about but it could be there isn’t and I can chill.

I don’t feel good maybe it’s the gabapentin withdrawal.
Your thought is very anti climaxical.
It’s not about the words it about how they make me feel.
It could be the characters are like from TikTok.
Can we chill and not work.
Perhaps say a sentence or two out once in a while.
 Each thought and reaction make a face, you always get a scared thought and feeling and make
the scared face and you always have a scary thought which make you always be making a
scary face and then a scared face consistently.
So make both faces.
Try keeping one face for more then 2 seconds.
Your thoughts change every 2 seconds so so does your face because a thought is a face.
Your thoughts create the illusion that there’s someone else here. There is no one else here.
You should be hearing the sound of an empty room with crickets chirping.
The quick transition are very mechanical like.
It’s supposed to be whatever chill and care free but these thoughts are quick and forceful.
There are no thoughts you are supposed to listen too or be afraid of.
There is nothing to be afraid of and no one here pressuring you.
It’s like arguing with a liar, they are just thoughts.

Maybe set up some faces like happy and serious.
I’m talking to anyone, I know that, it’s just that the thought makes a forceful false impression of
talking to someone or someone talking to you. Which it’s really just like your thought thinking in
3rd person.
I have a false impression of talking to someone and someone talking to me. It appears to be like
that.
Perhaps we want to change the impression to be that we are talking to ourself rather then to
someone else.
Also just notice that your thoughts do make an impression of talking to someone else and
someone talking to you.
You have an impression of someone working.
We gotta stop falling for the impressions.

With all the impressions going on trying to just stop and chill is difficult because it feels like the
impression of abruptly ignoring people.
Which impression do you think is your actual impression.
When you talk you stay in one something closer to your natural impression versus when you
think it might be changing faster and might be something different then your natural impression.
Maybe the bearded impression is installed in your brain
It makes sense you have a serious thought impression character from the time you had a beard
and were thinking in a serious tone and listening to serious songs.
And there may be also a impression of a more childish character from before or after the beard.
After taking off the beard and started thinking less serious it could be the serious thought
impressions gave off different impressions.

You can ignore the thought impression and feelings. But how are you going to ignore the
feelings, and what does knowing the different impressions help us out, and what do we need
help figuring out.
Maybe we had a lot to think and we just gotta let it sink in.
Naturally we are gonna follow are feelings and try to keep them comfortable.
 Over exaggerate the impressions tomorrow.
At least there’s no pain, perhaps that’s why I was so afraid because it was so painful.
 First day
I don’t want to stir things up let’s start in the morning
There’s longer pauses
Head feels sore and relief
Old habits
Nervous about stirring it back up
Why aren’t we so excited
We are kinda just crossing our fingers hoping it’s really better
Gotta get through the basics
We are crying
Manly cry
Adorable
Want to finish venting
Mood
Next mood we can go through things
Feeling like sad for what we went through
I’m finding it difficult to remain at my mood
Doo ok not want the tease just wanna be a couple days past good
I’m just gonna wait a week
After venting we have conversations available
I’m a little angry
Can’t know everything oddly
How about a joke
Wonder if it’s who’s who
Adorable likes dog
Can’t seem to not disturb your mood
Aversion to odd
Everything we do is odd
Extreme tendencies
I don’t like this analyzing adorable
I feel straight at the moment
It’s different
It’s not as heavy
Not as squeezing
It’s not as fast
Longer pauses
Still gonna avert the bumpy
How do you feel about salamanders
Very good question
Like saying nothing personal for so long
I feel like someone for a second
Ask me any question for that matter
We might be all the same person with just different personalities
Do you remember…
 Can’t really get definitive answers at the moment perhaps with practice
Gershon?
Time will tell
Like let’s say you did say that instead of did you really say that
Feel like I got work to do
This is supposedly easy now I’m just not in the mood
Aversion to incorrect
Just want to chill
Later
You’re cooler then them
Cute very descriptive
We don’t read the way you say something like empathy
We just listen to the words
Average
I wanna stop taking notes
Fast land
This is easy now
Overthinking it over feeling it if you want
New mood
What it’s supposed to do
Perhaps like majority decides
Sore
How there’s nothing there
My head
Is it anatomy
My brain
Majority
Not what I want?
Fair point
It’s better
Don’t tease
He’s good like that
If I don’t associate
It’s like you keep going back and forth and that’s like interrupting the train of thought
Don’t tease like a computer
Compliment
You’re used to jamming thoughts
You don’t have to say majority every time
You’re good
You over do it you get each one very fast
Idk
Cool o didn’t think of that
We can stop running
What are you doing
 I didn’t I’m not
It’s no one
I don’t know what you think I’m here
I didn’t say that
I didn’t say this
I’m not saying anything so why do you think I’m here
Someone be him
I’m him
He might be here
You can’t be him
You’re doing a good job for who you are
Ok one sec
Such a better one
Can’t stop laughing
Very funny dynamic
Now let it go by itself
Sure
Get rekt
It wasn’t me it was you
What you say might be what someone else says?
No matter what is being said I have to say it so it’s like I said it
The basics
Thinking about alters makes you switch more
Who’s fronting
John and jay sounds good but how many really
I didn’t want you to actually stop and think about that
Who’s fronting or what?
I know what the kids is like what are the gentlemen like
Who should do this
Kid and gentleman
It’s a lot of pressure
The kid is a gentleman
How about the kid and the gentleman
When composed
It makes sense we don’t know what to do about the pressure
Not everyone is the gentleman and the kid
Omg
It could be that’s why they can’t stop it
We are not so perfect
Yeah but why is it so computer like
I talk like I’m under a lot of pressure but I’m not
There no such thing as your thoughts being squeezed
I am not being squeezed
What is being squeezed
 We repeat because we are also asking something else
Our talking is being squeezed
He didn’t let adults speak
Your Easter aversion makes me think it’s better then I think
Like your attention or focus or the place you think with or something is being squeezed
Like my soul is being squeezed
Aversions are counterintuitive in a way
Like you can’t help yourself it feels so good
Under a lot of pressure
It’s not that big a deal
I’m also being squeezed
Does anyone not feel the pressure
I didn’t think so
It should probably be the first thing we talk about or be aware of
We should be able to vent ourself under this pressure
We shouldn’t be sounding this calm
What does that even mean the place we think out of is being squeezed
That’s the question
Maybe some alters don’t feel like the whole person
I feel like a floating person in this head and I’m being squeezed
When do you feel squeezed
Maybe I was squeezing
Wish it was that simple
Is it different
Still gonna be thinking but better
Still being squeezed
We are not thinking
I think it’s good make it more
Can’t not think about it for some reason
It’s different
Our brain is being squeezed
Coffee?
We used to be dependent on coffee
Maybe our brain is wired like with it
Squeezed and speed but is slower
That’s what’s different it’s slower
I’m more curious why I try to stop you
There’s nothing you can do about it now because you are going slow good
It’s like we were never going fast
What do you want to do now
I’m being squeezed to ask
I’m being squeezed to answer
I’m can’t sit still
I wanna get the thoughts out of my head onto something
 Voice recorder
Maybe the pressure is fine
I think the talking outloud is good
My the pressure is just regular DID
Maybe we should make it more pressure just so we know it’s fine
The kid sums it up
Ok we did more pressure and it didn’t really change
Now we think it’s just how DID feels
That’s less stressful
Too good to be true
That’s an easy way to decide things
It’s a delusion that we think if we think too much it will stuff up our head
It’s just a continuous same amount of pressure because of DID
What age is the kid is the kid really that young
I’m curious
It makes sense we don’t know
It’s like two alters trying to use the head
Maybe we should do the names thing
We used to do that before we got squished
June and John
It could be June is a 100
Made you think
Anyone want the front?
The name system
I can’t think why I do want front
Wow who do I want
Who’s deciding
Names make switch’s
It feels like the naming system used to regulate the system
We need more names
Ain’t no story
June might just be stoned
I want to jog
I wanna play basketball
I wanna go skateboarding
Either it’s a really good idea or I’m stoned
Which name would work
Any particular reason to pick a specific name
June sounds like fun
But let’s pretend you’re not really anyone
We are stuck at umm but I thing the pressure is going down
Makes sense because this is what we thought was causing the pressure
Can we let go
It feels like it’s draining
 It’s obviously not exactly it’s a attempt
It might be someone young wanting someone young as a friend
We needa find June a friend
Do we have another name similar to June
I don’t think we can actually attempt another June like
Maybe gg
Are we the same person let’s say John and June?
John you know what
G is front
It doesn’t make sense to pass it to a little
He might not be a little
He sounds like one
It could be he wants to talk
Talking voice name gershon
Is there something to do?
Ok chill
We used to have to smk to use the naming system
We are having conversations close to what they are trying to be
I think the pressure is going down
And it’s going slower
Maybe try again in a couple hours
Maybe just keep practicing the talking
What should we do
Why is that such a hard question
We think talk on balance is realizing a lot of pressure
Like talking was the key to keeping it slow
Let’s Keep talking till we had enough
Your voice sounding different is a good confirmation of DID
The more you dissociate the Benji you can be
It’s like meditation odd thought experiments
Benji I can feel you
Benji didn’t talk
How do you know what cute is
Benji is yay
You can have alters of alters
We need Benji
Maybe love
Resonate
Why does we need Benji resonate so much
Maybe it has to do with our past marriage
I need her
Addiction
Withdrawal from her
I need Charlie
 I think your name is June now
Maybe we can call you Charlie if you want
Who was married to Charlie
It could be just two random alters
Cuddle
So we are healthy and healed
Feather gershon and feather Charlie
I think it was a relationship withdrawal
Like a co dependent relationship
June is little gershon
June and Charlie
Age slider Charlie age slider gershon
We never did Charlie’s side
My name was also charlie
Your name was also we forgot
Charlie might be age sliding somewhere else right now
It’s maybe amnesia wall
Maybe we are just on different slides and just chill with that
Ok
I need Charlie
Maybe I’m Charlie and I need femboy
They are the only names that remain
Fem boy is #1
Fem boy pretends not to like Charlie and Charlie pretends not to like fem boy
I need both might be they need each other
I think this is the way
You seem rehydrated
We are just going off of the script what is it really
Charlie and fem boy are friends
Maybe Brooklyn
Brooklyn Femboy and Charlie
I think this alter needs femboy
I think another alter needs Charlie
I think Charlie needs Charlie but I forgot his name
It could be Charlie needs Brooklyn to help him
And Brooklyn needs femboy
I don’t know anymore I think we keep switching
Maybe all the cute stuff was like subconscious need to get back together
And all the pressure was like trying to cuddle
It might be two Littles and two fem boys
Pressure like when Ross was here
For the health of the system I need to think about you fem boy
Maybe addicted to the chemistry
Fem boy in general or fem boy in particular
 It’s the question
Sounds like a story it’s probably in general at this point
Charlie might be a femboy
Charlie is here femboy is not
Using my straight voice and my gay voice
The whole curious thing can create different personalities while trying to figure it out
Maybe I need both Charlie and femboy
It could be we are getting used to each others energies
I used to be younger
It used to be Charlie and femboy now it’s femboy and Charlie
It used to be only Charlie why is it now also fem boy
Aversion to Littles
I need fem boy but I must say Charlie
He might be like your subconscious telling you the truth
Charlie used to be everything
It means a lot more then finding a little cute
That word meant a whole lot to you for a long time
Like it could be like it’s the cores cry for help to associate


I need Charlie
I need myself
The end.

It could be I need Charlie means more then one thing
Who’s base
Myself came before Charlie
Maybe some subconscious attempt if there’s such a thing crying so to speak
The yourself you are looking for is the Charlie so to speak
It’s not an exact science
The aversion to gershon is supposed to make you want him more
I need myself more then I need anyone
It could be it was all a subconscious tale
Lost in dissociation trying to find yourself back
Sticky is the way
What do you mean gershon
What are you doing
Emotions meditation
Each to their own they need themselves
Am I gershon?
We can’t get ourselves right now so I need Charlie or femboy
Subconscious means our feelings
Following our feelings
Like our gut
 Charlie as a friend fem boy as a cuddle
Charlie used to be our cuddle
Maybe take a break
TikTok
It’s not gonna stop till he’s associated
A subconscious tale of your system
I think if I have fem boy it’s less pressure
Gershon you’re a fem boy and I need you
Ok me and Gershon
Charlie might be your subconscious guide
This could be whatever but whatever
Watch femboy
I don’t like this subconscious talk
You don’t leave many options
Maybe gg
I need my feelings is another big one
Maybe Charlie is the voice of my feelings
A femboys feelings can sound like a Charlie
I need Charlie
I need my feelings and emotions and my heart
Let the rest go by itself
It’s all speculative
Lawyer
Bi femboy dopamine
Is gg more potent then we think
We used to know nothing but remember Charlie and that was everything

Way too much in a different way
We need a break
It’s really hard to stop
Watch TikTok
Maybe Talk about random stuff like old memories
Ouch but it’s really is better and will be even better after the dust settles like before
Talking about your trauma always helps
A lot to process
Cute pain reliever
We are talking better like balance
Emotional tolling
Squint your face like Benji
I’m not a computer like I got feelings and emotions
Do the face thing
Like inner child
Push through
Culture shock
 Maybe it’s fine
Not too much pressure now too much emotional
We lack words
We aren’t talking against the pressure anymore so that’s good
First overwhelming the healing
Motivation
Minimal
Tomorrow should be less pressure
The naming system
John help
Balance ease
Maybe it helped
Maybe it’s always the same amount of pressure
We had no shot for a minute
Maybe it’s nicotine
I Gotta stay strong
Brute
How you smiling
My left thumb is moving
We are thinking less
Hold your thumb
Maybe it was never pressure in your head
Maybe the kid is here because he can handle the hurt
No weak. Now lol
It will break us all
I used to be a rabbi
Later
Hold you hand
Have to say what I don’t want to say
Everything is so triggering in fast land
Manic
Everything is like what did you just say?
I think this is the best night yet
Keep your mouth open and move your jaw
Breath through your mouth
I don’t want to
I’m kinda forced to use a baby voice
New train of thought
How have we not ran out of things to write down
Beats me
It’s a conversation maybe
New train of thought second that
Can’t
We’ll try
 No talking TikTok’s
I’m allergic to bs
Like there was never ever pressure
Sexist
I know the script I’m just checking my feelings
What type of heart does your heart feel like
My hearts offline
Maybe not Benji
You’re not arguing with a brain you’re arguing with a heart
Listen to the podcast
Someone else started rallying while your talking
Less nic see if better
I guess you’re taking a random thought seriously
Write down all your traumas and triggers
The left thumb feeling used to be a full body experience
Talking outlandish really helps me see the landish
I use to sit on the blue chair and regulate all the delusional sensory or DID related
And then one day I just ignored them
Now it’s all squashed together on my left thumb and maybe my head
Ain’t no one sane in a fox hole
It hurts so we must follow what’s most interesting like to keep us spaced out the most
Keeps you stronger if you stay in your head
It’s so slow like nothing ever happened
Agitation
Needa unwind
I don’t feel the need to try to figure anything out just unwind
I think this is the best yet
Schizophrenia might try to prove itself to you
We are overdoing it by thinking instead of watching tv
We are trying to figure out how to make it hurt less
I don’t feel good
It’s the slowest it’s ever been
Maybe better enough to know it doesn’t feel good
It’s easier to think but it might hurt it bot but it might be less
I don’t know if it hurts or stressed
It’s uncomfortable
It might not get more stuffed
Feels better then usual
Might not be certain about the feeling but the thinking is better
Waiting for the influx to go down
Maybe there’s nothing
Wanna talk about what hurts
Maybe happy thoughts
It hurts to think
 I think the advil helped
It hurts to think
I can’t stop thinking
We can think about anything it just hurts and might stir up more thoughts
We need a name for older then a kid and younger then a man
It does hurt or it doesn’t hurt
Sweet sad
Sensitive heart
New style of thinking
Like there was never a different way
I let go now it’s peeking
We can write a novel
It like peaked now it’s regulating
Numbers over thinking
Regulating
No shot
Color
Cute is the only good thing I have
What should we talk about
Everything is good
Eggshells
No more notes
Gotta say a thought every once in a while
If I could think
We say what we don’t want to say
Relief of pain after a year can make you happy
Sensitive is a skill
Slowly
Less thumb feeling
Maybe boys
Life
Keep guessing
Intruding thoughts
Little alter
Just cute
I can’t continue laughing because I’m not sure if I’m the one who got the joke
No thinking conundrum
We only stirred because we were trying to figure something out now there’s nothing to figure out
No shot second time
Should be getting more no shots
It’s looking up
Can we regular think
Hesitant and curios.
Not bumpy
 Half curious
Thinking non conundrum
Femboy stress test
Nothing that a little boy can’t handle
The basics
Easier when slower
Sometimes talking to myself
It might stir up again
By no shot 10 it should be pretty good
Lower our expectations
It’s like talking with a voice changer
Next wave soon
Maybe not
That made us all really sad
I’m sorry
You seem older then me
It feels like we are still there
Ordeal toll vibe
Should be crying
Sssshhhh
Like dogs they can’t think or change their feelings
We will get to that in more details later
How do I feel
The vibe
The vibe system
My vibe and the systems vibe
The pets system
Nice checkpoint
Maybe focus on your own vibe too
You’re just a boy so don’t worry too much about us
Pets untill front
Just trying here
A checkpoint for trying to understand how a system works
Who do we think we are talking too
I think we are talking to an alter not the boy
Don’t associate
Enough to get by
Gotta double check
Try to not take a note
Don’t gotta think every thought no more
Heaven
We can’t see how useful it might be
Unless you don’t Like it
I think you’re trying to hard
 We seem to have to be trying
We are like forced to be trying
A caretaker is forced to keep trying maybe
You are also asking yourself questions in third person
It’s probably the many alters why it feels forced
Sprained ankle maybe
Maybe it’s fine it doesn’t hurt
Repeat the thoughts slower
It’s might be working too much
Ouch I would racer not associate?
Don’t push while you think
It might be fine
I think not pushing is a good start
Small talk
I think pushing is the start
Everything is repeated untill big talk
Make it into small talk
As loo ok my as you’re not pushin
We dismiss anyone that sounds different
Big talk
The kids look down
It is what it is
It might be fine to push
I’m hesitant to let pushing
It’s gonna stick to it while we go through alters
Maybe if you move your head there less pushing

There a situation
Any thought that goes fast repeat it slower
There’s a situation here too I think we are the kids
I think our old story kept its impulses
I gotta make sure no pushing will hold through
What’s the situation
What about bots
There was pushing
Whatever you know what I mean
Do I know what I mean
They don’t
Any thought that you do not repeat doesn’t know what it means
My situation is I need to do it
You’re situation is you need I don’t do to not
Do one and you’ll see not to do any
You chose to do that one
As long as you don’t push is good but we make it like it’s someone
 Because of the situation we seem to have to find one thing and repeat it
Like a mantra
We are not thinking with words
It’s like the pushing is like you blocking a thought
I will hold through to that
I am blocking thoughts
I am probably blocking a lot more
I am pushing to much
Chill with something to do
Amnesia wall
Avoid amnesia
I don’t really know something when I say it
We all don’t really know what we are doing
We can’t do anything else because it will be pushing and I won’t let
You don’t know what you’re doing
You’re trying to put words to every thought
You’re making a thought be someone
We all thing we feel the way to the solution
You think I know what I’m talking about
All the eye movement is amnesia

Maybe we should just talk about you blocking thoughts
You will only listen to yourself
It’s just me deciding to make the funny voices
I know which voice I’m making on purpose
Conversation start with already a impression
New impression
I use amnesia for everything
Like I’m skilled at it
It’s gonna take us off track
It’s like you take the you being odd for all of us
I’ll say it

Off tracks and amnesia
I’m odd like that so you don’t have to stop
Off track
We are trying hard
Like we have too
I’m odd too because I act odd
Who decides the track
Me really fast and under pressure
I will Let the rest go by itself
Let’s talk about fem
Reverse amnesia after the new impression
 Any excuse to talk about it
It’s such a relaxing thought
We might forget and talk about it
Benji
They are trying not to get distracted
This should only take like 2 more tries
How were we getting distracted till now
Try to distract us
They don’t exist
They are distracted and not trying
Don’t listen to adult voices they are fake
It all shows the situation
Of course after the fact
After the new impression
Of a kid and a adult
Make it easier for us
For who?
Maybe alters
Isn’t just me a kid and everything else is just thoughts
It’s easy for you to be a kid so this makes it easy
And you can be a man
Doing it this way makes it easy to do something
Don’t get us distracted
I’m always gonna because I’m a boy
Be black
Mention black we stop being aggressive
It is what it is
Jew
Probably like 10 more tries
Try is too boy we are kid and they are men
You aren’t doing anything
I think they realize more quickly that it’s a waste of their time
Or you associate so you stopped doing it
You don’t realize that’s it’s a waste of your time
Do we like have to or something
Or is it just me
It might be a waste of our time too
So for men it’s Benji
For kids it’s kids
What’s not a waste of time
Who
It just ends up being me and me
10 more tries
We are realizing faster
 I think us too because it’s just not us
Tomorrow should be good
You’ll see at next note
Gay
Amnesia
I’m both saying it and blocking it
After the new impression you don’t have to try hard anymore
Stand still
Be rude
Anything sticky
You’re recalling telling it to yourself but end up thinking it’s someone else
We would rather do our own thing
I think riddle solved
Smile
Whatever is easiest

It’s done

I’m off like that
I’m odd like that too
Off track
Amnesia wall
As long as you’re not pushing
DID research.
 Brute vs Shy.
Buffalo vs New Jersey.

I’ve always been shy so where are the nine shy voices from. Maybe from Morristown.

Shy unloved abandoned neglected brainwashed traumatized lone wolf.
Shy listening to all the not shy voices.
Suppressing my bruteness.
My bruteness bullies me when I’m shy.

They broke me as a kid so I would listen and be more easily brainwashed and conditioned.
I used to be a troublemaker till high school.
Then I became shy. When it was about looking good in a mirror and losing weight and cool
friends.
And maybe also because of the screaming principal while all alone in boarding school.

I have always been shy when talking in real life.
But for some time I wasn’t shy when talking in my head.
But when I worked on mars I wasn’t shy talking in my head. Or when I was in Morristown.
Alone I was very not shy.
But then Maybe the past couple months made you more shy being so scared to have any
thought.

I can talk in very not shy voices. But I cut myself off because im shy. And interrupt myself
because im shy.
And can’t do what I want to do because I gotta check first for approval because im shy.

Abandoned helpless terrified shy kitten.
What to do for shy.
I’m shy and a brute.
When I’m cornered and unable to move I’m shy. Once I move I’m a brute.

Shy. Maybe from child abuse.
We overload our shy feelings and put on a beard and became a brute over night.
We became who we hated our untied life in order to get stronger then them and what they did to
our brain.
I was too shy to handle conspiracy theories so I had to become a brute to stop tripping.
Then after 3 years I tried to retrieve my shy feelings but then my brute started bullying my
shyness.
Then I became more shy on purpose to be more sensitive and nice.
Shy while resting. Don’t wake me up.
Shy conserves energy.
You wear a beard when you think.
 Not talking help me conserve my energy but I become shy and can’t respond.
When I talk I’m not shy but I use my energy.
I can’t do anything wrong. But shy thinks he’s always doing something wrong.
Shy rests. Brute talks.
2 second rest then a thought that wakes you up then repeats.
Don’t think it’s not going fast.
Thinking fast while trying to avoid waking ourselves up.

The brute sleeps shy takes over. The brute is always sleeping. I’m too exhausted to use my
brute energy.
But enough energy to have a intruding brute force but to exhausted to respond brutefully.
Too exhausted to defend my shy feelings and too exhausted to ignore them.
Shy thinks he’s 15.
Religion is child abuse.
Wtf is holy and how is it legal.

Finally not shy.
Is my heart feeling emotions without me.
Say stop.
Shadow work.
Every thought begins with being shy.
Because you’re shy and your thoughts are not shy it creates the atmosphere like people are
talking to you.
Because you’re shy your eyes dart towards every thought.
Lots of topics are nerve wracking because you’re shy.
Maybe what you feel is your nerves.
Breathing makes your eyes dart more.
You’re trying not to think.

It seems it’s great efficiency to talk in general to know who you are and maybe more efficient to
figure out what to talk about specifically.

What’s wrong.
My eyes are darting around a lot.
It’s difficult to think.
I feel something strange.
I get scared.
I’m shy.
I need energy.
I need to talk.
I need to chill.
I feel a pressure to not relax and to think more to figure something out.

What to talk about.
 What to figure out.
I feel pressured to work harder but I want to feel like there’s no pressure to figure something out
as soon as possible.
Who’s pressuring you. No one. My brute side. Myself.
Conflicting feelings.
Trauma. Shy. Heal. Brute.

Talk at your own pace.
Talk when you can feel like it.
Find any excuse to talk.
It makes sense that the better you breathe the better you think.
When you’re shy it’s harder to laugh.
It’s natural to think that but who I’m I saying that to. Shy.
The better you breathe the better you think.
Squint your face.
Conflicting feelings keep you spinning.
Talking feels great.

What to do if you’re gonna forget everything.
Breathing helps you think better.
Talking feels great.
Talk in the exhale.

Your thoughts persist on thinking about what you don’t want so corner them.
Are you waiting for someone to tell you what to do.
Talking adds sound to life.
It’s feels like I’m being judge for every word I say.
It might just be for the first impression to your self.

How is the school legal.
They got good lawyers.

You don’t talk because you’re trying to watch tv.
Maybe there’s a middle ground.
We haven’t talked in 9 months.
Cut yourself some slack.

I haven’t talked in 9 months.
What do I make of that.

I talk so little that I wonder what’s worth talking about when you do.
Like what.
Like something that would help me when I’m not talking.
Can I sit still and talk or just talk somehow or read.
 Why can’t I sit still.
Try 1 minute.
It’s painful.
Maybe withdrawal.
Talking hurts.
I think it hurts less if I follow the feelings.

The last thing.
It hurts to sit still.

You’re constantly saying aahhh it hurts.
Sue them for overdosing you.

I might be under the false impression that every thought scares me. It might just be every
thought hurts because I’m already in pain and thoughts just interrupt my healing rest.
I can’t sit still and think slowly when my mind is racing and I get bored fast and restless.
Try 1 minute at a time.

First it hurt and I vented the pain.
Then it got too boring to stay.
Maybe breathing will help it more.
No one know something you don’t know.

Just try to talk as much as you can whenever.
I don’t know why but I think it’s a good idea.
I only talk when I’m not watching tv.
How to deal with not talking disturbances.

There’s only one thing not boring to talk about.
Maybe two or three.
Religion schizophrenia and personality.

Others.
Content.
Money.

You gotta get used to being wrong and finishing your sentence.
Do we have to force ourselves to breathe.

If you get stuck something realize you can get the same stuck on something stupid like free
bark.

Do the short thinking till you’re in the middle of a conversation then you will have something to
talk about.
 Just say yeah yeah yeah to the same thing.

You might think like an adult but you feelings and emotions might be that of a kids.

What would a thought sound like if you weee talking to yourself.
Maybe you’re fruity.
One thought many perspectives.
You pretend like you’re not thinking. I think that creates confusion.

My heart hurts.
Maybe it’s because of the new rougher situation where we are talking and breathing more and
it’s getting used to it.

Pretend like you’re thinking.
We don’t always have an answer for every thought.
Maybe try to know what you want without thinking.
Maybe try acting out the characters in you head in real life.

Pick your self up.
Talk.
What happens when you don’t pick yourself up.
I get confused.
Man down.

It’s difficult to change the way your voice sounds in your head.
It could be you’re cutting off the thought because you want to change the way it sounds.
It might be out of your comfort zone to talk the way you think.
Repeat your last sentence.
Stop getting embarrassed.

The thoughts voices make it sound that it’s dramatic.
Maybe your voice will make it sound less dramatic.
What else.
We can’t pick ourself up even if we talk.

Talk in your fallback voice. Because you always get stuck there.
You’re listening instead of talking.
The more we talk in our fall back voice the better it is for picking yourself up.
Pick yourself up from your fallback voice.
Stop listening.

Rough world for a soft guy.
Sometimes I’m soft sometimes I’m hard. Bi.
 When you’re hard you’re much older.
When you’re soft you’re much younger.
Hard me stops me from being soft and soft me stops a lot when I’m too hard.
Spend time being soft to strengthen the soft.
Talk softly. Listen softly.
You only have hard thoughts. So everything soft says, hard responds challenging it.
How do we get soft thoughts.
It’s always hard asking and soft has to respond.

When I’m soft I forget I’m hard.
Be soft and hard.
Sometimes you run ahead of yourself.
Breathe soft.
Get used to switching between soft and hard.
Get used to talking soft then hard.
What about how weird it sounds.
Confusion is real when you get ahead of yourself when you drastically change between hard
and soft.
When you change between soft and hard you change personalities.
Confusion is real.
Sometimes it goes faster then you can.

Soft: is it done yet.
Hard: is it done yet.

Hard: sometimes it goes faster then you and confuses you.
Once it goes slow it will be done.

How would you read something to yourself.

When it goes faster then you you get confused and ahead of yourself.
I forget everything I become soft and forget I’m hard.
Practice breaking out of soft and breaking out of hard.
Go hard if you want to decide something. Or soft.
Didn’t matter what the thought is as long as it’s hard or soft.
Avoid confusion.

What to know if you’re gonna forget everything.
Go hard.

Whichever voice you use you forget any other one.
Let confusion drain out.
 Why so much hurt. Maybe the confusion can make my heart hurt. Maybe because you don’t
breathe good enough.
We worry so much.
Breathe with you stomach.

Because it’s happens by it self you smart to do it on purpose. Switching between soft and hard
voice.
It’s fun to talk soft and there’s not a lot to do.
The voice of my thought determines my personality.
Our thoughts jump ahead of us and feel like a personality.
Ignoring a thought voice creates confusion.
There’s the soft voice and there’s a hard voice and maybe there’s a middle voice that you would
use if you could choose.
Maybe we got to play along to avoid confusion.
Maybe we gotta get used to using the different voices and personalities.

You got schizophrenia with delusional paranoia.
Have fun with the personalities.
Fast or slow. Soft or hard.
If it hurts at least slow down your thoughts and or make the hurting face. And breathe.
Avoiding is too much energy maybe play along.

Maybe try learning something like riddles.
We ran out of things to think about.
Passive or aggressive. Soft or hard. Slow or fast.
I’m in disarray.

Build some self esteem.
I’m the goat.

Right now we are in entropy trying to reach order.
What to do about being in disarray.
Try thinking without listening or talking.
Sing a song. Hey dum diddly dum.

Disarray. Overwhelmed.
Stop listening to your feelings and monkey random thoughts.
Take breaks.
Stop thinking.
At least your heart don’t hurt.

Monkey stop thinking.
The end.
 Stop thinking or stop thinken.
Talk Think or don’t talk think there’s nothing in between.
Everything you say is scrutinized by a nerd brainiac.

Talk. Stop thinking. Breathe.
Brainiac stop thinking.
Mantra.

There’s no time to figure what out.
How to think better.
Talk.
How to think fast better.
Think fast.
How to think fast better while slow.

Make the face you feel like making.
Can’t stop thinking.
Talk slow.
Count numbers.

Be simple stop one uping yourself.
Why is every thought a thought I don’t want to have.
Maybe let odeals pass by.
Plothole brainiac.
Gotta figure out how to think better.
Maybe think with more grace.
Choose a nicer time to think.
It’s hard to think when it hurts.
Every thought feels like a punch to the stomach.
Make the hurt face when it hurts.

Default is hurt face when it hurts.
The face is dynamic.
Stay on the current face.
The face is real watch the face.
Avoiding the face feels strange.
Stay in the vicinity of what the face feels like.

You’ll have a chance to answer if you do the vicinity face.
How to pick yourself up from your vicinity face.
Your vicinity face might be with your mouth open.
Stop thinking and stop worrying.
I want to let go.
Give in to out of patients.
 It might get uncomfortable because of gabapentin withdrawal so try to take it easy.
Think fast.
You can make the vicinity face when it gets uncomfortable.
For the fast ones go fast.
Thinking fast is as good as not thinking.

You talk low so you can continue thinking fast.
Try to slow me down.
Your natural thought will just continue the same topic to have different thoughts you need to try
to think of something else.
Your natural thoughts just think about your thoughts.
Go fast through the thoughts you don’t want to stop at and go slow at the thoughts you feel like.
If y oh need a break make the break face.
Breathe.
Stop making sudden movements.
Try to stop it from going faster.
They face of trying to stop it from going faster.
Holding your breath help you stay at one face.

Quit talking like a child.
Keep it slow.
Quick change. Take it easy.
When I talk slow I talk like a child.
When I talk like a child I trip.
Talk fast to talk like an adult.
Which slow adult voice would you like to use.

I am tripping.
Lucid trip.
There’s no such thing as a lucid trip.

Open your mouth breathe through your nose.
It’s like turning the corner every second and getting shocked by the beer.
Make the hurt face.
Go fast.
Breathe.
You’re tripping.
No hard questions.
Space out.
Stay on one thought.
Talk about how much it hurts.
Thinking fast gives you energy.
There’s nothing to think about and there’s nothing to stop thinking.
There nothing to think about just continue watching videos.
 Make some videos of yourself see how dissociated you are.
Stop stopping.

Stuffing precautions
We can use triggering words

Maybe that’s what dissociating means
Your body is one association and your dissociating

Waste time
Very smart

It’s all about being nervous

See how many diamonds you can mind

It’s like as you’re saying it you’re saying it sarcastically

If my body wasn’t nervous I walk t be nervous

Switch between body (host) and alter

If it was up to me I would think before I react

What are you nervous about?
You’re nervous about finding something you’re nervous about.
Client deadlines
Depressing stuff
Nervous that I’ll say something silly

What should we do the body is nervous
Waste time
We can make it a situation where a person that was nervous would stop being nervous
 You can’t change the body but you can change the situation

I am nervous what do I think I should do about it
 I should think about it till my body stops being nervous


The feeling is probably nervous

Right place feels good

John does have a reaction but doesn’t show it

Anything?

That’s depressing
We don’t need too

Nervous bored

We will be less nervous later
Save our thoughts for then

Why am I nervous

Act nervous

Why is there someone at that speed

Scared me into a little boy

When we go slow I’ll work

Maybe I should start thinking

Nervousness, fast, silly.

When nervous talk about it

No not that do this

Talk and think in front of a mirror

 We are not getting scared

It’s gonna be a little uncomfortable being confused

Qaute on qaute

It’s more staying on train of thought then avoiding thoughts

So much to do

Thinking time is very valuable
Suppose is why one would react a away to distractions

Gotta let loose a bit
 Like there’s no bottom

Best yet

We will heal

Maybe stop thinking about nothing

Like it’s live chat

Be a character idea

I think it’s easier to think when you move

It’s a bit scary

Umm is the same as I guess

Probably is like umm and I guess

Probably another 260 questions

Probably just our own thoughts and feelings question or another alter

Any new guess is a good guess

Stop questioning

If you’re at 260 you’re pretty strong
 Maybe we are mistaking my feelings for another alter

At 260 things like this can help

None of us are trying to question

Knowing our alters would help

Why must be question

Whatever you want
Track will help it go slower

How can I forget stuff is there
Bigger trips when slow
If someone was cold we would probably not get stuck a lot
 So no one is cold?
What’s up?
 It’s scary having such good things happening to us
 Pen and paper
 Less tension
When’s gonna be the last one
 You’re doing it to yourself
  It’s the fastest least energy way

Space out reduces tension

It’s the damn school man.
I want to feel laughing.

What do you mean someone else
Like is it someone else sharing my body that has different thoughts
Or like I switch between personalities and it’s really just me switching
What about if I hear their response is it my response or someone else’s
It’s complicated

Like picking a needle in a jay stack
To fast to know
Presumably any alter that joins probably tried to help out
