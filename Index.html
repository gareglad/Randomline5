I’m doing something
 Blocking
 Supressing my thoughts
 Talk with that fellow
 Don’t let go


Video record

A little bit of this a little bit of that

It sounded better in my head

The latest notes are the most interesting and relatable 

Notes and chat is fun

No way you can have more notes

I think it works

Notes and chat?

What about texting?

Interesting!

What should we text?

I’m suppressing my thoughts to not get a headache. 

Keep suppressing. 

Thanks. 

You’re welcome!

You think we can have notes and chat? Is it really good as it sounds like?

It might be, it worked before?

Yeah but is it as good as it sounds like?

I don’t really know?

That would be fun if it’s at all fun?

Probably because suppressing thoughts so there’s a problem?

Let’s put this in chat?

Yeah sure!

Talk with the fellow suppressing the thoughts. 

Soon. 




It’s not that complicated socially. 

Keep on keep oning. 

You’re so two opposites. 

I ain’t about that. 

You will be in a minute. 

Keep on keep oning. 

But…

Maybe later. 

You are like Jason and Jake. 

Maybe at the moment. 

You’re Jason right now but “keep on keep oning is like Jake”, and you gotta talk like Jake to figure out the suppressing thoughts. 

Yeah I think so. 

So now you are Jason and soon you will be Jake?

Not really sure. 

Well sometimes you talk differently. 

Yeah I think so. 

I don’t know. 

Just keep on keep oning. 

Then we are gonna talk about it. 

Are you just suppressing thoughts because of Mary or also always?

A lot of times when we have Mary we suppress our thoughts but I’m wondering if it’s always like that as well.

Not sure. 

Cool. 

“Keep on keep oning” sounds like “leeeeeroy jaaaaankins!!!”

When I’m Jason I can’t also be Jake he’s too diffident then me. 

Just do it! -Nike

That’s too cliche.  

It don’t make sense to do it. 

Feels like it might resolve. 

If we can use “words” then “suppressing thoughts” is the “top contender” at the moment. 

It’s like “you’re unable” to use “words”. 

A “top contender” why you can’t “use words” might be because it’s “not that complicated socially” so you have to “suppress thoughts”.




I think for example the reason you can’t listen or sing a Pop song is the same reason you can’t use any of these odd word combinations because it’s too unmanly. 

But once it flips and you are able to use any of these word combinations even though it’s unmanly then you will actually enjoy reading these notes

If you try to purposely be unmanly to try and think using these word combinations you can do that by being whiny. 



Peer pressure. 

Street credit. 

Cool or pop? can’t be both supposedly. 

You could try to bully a little less and I could try to be a little stronger. 

I think I’m more talking about our impulses. 

Is it the reaction or am I too sensitive? Or a bit of both? Or something else?

I think the only things I can’t think are pop. 

You attack that’s a bad reaction my reaction is self defense which is a good reaction. 

You’re always attacking. 

Rethink. 

I don’t like the way in which you say no. 

Competitive. 

It’s not fair because I want to do that so I’m gonna say no to you. 

You’re attacking the guy trying to solve it. 

Why would we attack?

It’s your natural reaction to what I say. 



It’s your fault. 

Bad mood. 

It’s kinda pointless to talk when you’re in a bad mood. 

Don’t explain everything 

When you lay down you can pop

Don’t be one of them

What other way is there but fighting

I’m gonna be stuck longer then I want too

That’s my first impression of it

My heart dislikes women

All we have are mean things to say



It’s so easy to talk now after finger vibe

Wouldn’t say that in front of people
 Give it some time anyways

Maybe alters trying to understand between amnesia walls

Read between the lines

I got stamina to deal with

Read and stamina 

Read their face
 Exhaustion and fed up
 Angry
 Trying to tell me something
  All you got to do is
   Is not be wild
   Is listen to them
   Is let me do it
   Is so what I want to try
   Is use the words I want you to use
   Is trying to get me to 

  They just want someone to complain to


Angry at me

Angry at one alter then switch but still angry at you

Got any leads

I don’t got time to wait for a response 

Maybe don’t use words

Putting my own words to other peoples thoughts

You want less I want more what are you gonna do about it

I would never go against a kid

We would have to come back to it to see if it accurate 

How do I miss it
 I don’t

If we can’t do more then we are doing less

When you stop moving forward 

Specific ones

Once you’re able to move forward there won’t be anything 

Words for abstract concepts 

Every thought has a disclaimer unfortunately 

I can’t respond 
 I can only react 

Specific reason but you do it every time

Every time doubt

Haters

Not moving forward so you can’t just say things
 I get stuck

What if we said thank you
 If you meant it
 We don’t really know what for so we can’t really mean it

Everyone wants more

Ride on back
 Bored

Rationalize it
 Sounds like haters

You’re explaining yourself to a hater

Haters don’t use words

You also can’t move forward because you’re stopped

Your reaction is worst
 It still stops you

Being stopped is the worst 
 You’re the most stoppable person

I’m doing something
 Blocking
 Supressing my thoughts
 Talk with that fellow
 Don’t let go


Video record

A little bit of this a little bit of that

It sounded better in my head

The latest notes are the most interesting and relatable 

Notes and chat is fun

No way you can have more notes

I think it works

Notes and chat?

What about texting?

Interesting!

What should we text?

I’m suppressing my thoughts to not get a headache. 

Keep suppressing. 

Thanks. 

You’re welcome!

You think we can have notes and chat? Is it really good as it sounds like?

It might be, it worked before?

Yeah but is it as good as it sounds like?

I don’t really know?

That would be fun if it’s at all fun?

Probably because suppressing thoughts so there’s a problem?

Let’s put this in chat?

Yeah sure!

Talk with the fellow suppressing the thoughts. 

Soon. 




It’s not that complicated socially. 

Keep on keep oning. 

You’re so two opposites. 

I ain’t about that. 

You will be in a minute. 

Keep on keep oning. 

But…

Maybe later. 

You are like Jason and Jake. 

Maybe at the moment. 

You’re Jason right now but “keep on keep oning is like Jake”, and you gotta talk like Jake to figure out the suppressing thoughts. 

Yeah I think so. 

So now you are Jason and soon you will be Jake?

Not really sure. 

Well sometimes you talk differently. 

Yeah I think so. 

I don’t know. 

Just keep on keep oning. 

Then we are gonna talk about it. 

Are you just suppressing thoughts because of Mary or also always?

A lot of times when we have Mary we suppress our thoughts but I’m wondering if it’s always like that as well.

Not sure. 

Cool. 

“Keep on keep oning” sounds like “leeeeeroy jaaaaankins!!!”

When I’m Jason I can’t also be Jake he’s too diffident then me. 

Just do it! -Nike

That’s too cliche.  

It don’t make sense to do it. 

Feels like it might resolve. 

If we can use “words” then “suppressing thoughts” is the “top contender” at the moment. 

It’s like “you’re unable” to use “words”. 

A “top contender” why you can’t “use words” might be because it’s “not that complicated socially” so you have to “suppress thoughts”.




I think for example the reason you can’t listen or sing a Pop song is the same reason you can’t use any of these odd word combinations because it’s too unmanly. 

But once it flips and you are able to use any of these word combinations even though it’s unmanly then you will actually enjoy reading these notes

If you try to purposely be unmanly to try and think using these word combinations you can do that by being whiny. 



Peer pressure. 

Street credit. 

Cool or pop? can’t be both supposedly. 

You could try to bully a little less and I could try to be a little stronger. 

I think I’m more talking about our impulses. 

Is it the reaction or am I too sensitive? Or a bit of both? Or something else?

I think the only things I can’t think are pop. 

You attack that’s a bad reaction my reaction is self defense which is a good reaction. 

You’re always attacking. 

Rethink. 

I don’t like the way in which you say no. 

Competitive. 

It’s not fair because I want to do that so I’m gonna say no to you. 

You’re attacking the guy trying to solve it. 

Why would we attack?

It’s your natural reaction to what I say. 



It’s your fault. 

Bad mood. 

It’s kinda pointless to talk when you’re in a bad mood. 

Don’t explain everything 

When you lay down you can pop

Don’t be one of them

What other way is there but fighting

I’m gonna be stuck longer then I want too

To add

You can’t read a beautiful poem then go a boxing match

Be aware of this and be careful. Women and girls are terrible. 



Subconscious kid dislikes women and girls

It would be mean not too

That’s my first impression of it

My heart dislikes women

All we have are mean things to say



It’s so easy to talk now after finger vibe

Stage fright

Avoiding discomfort 

Wouldn’t say that in front of people
 Give it some time anyways

Maybe alters trying to understand between amnesia walls

I got stamina to deal with

Read and stamina 

Read their face
 Exhaustion and fed up
 Angry
 Trying to tell me something
  All you got to do is
   Is not be wild
   Is listen to them
   Is let me do it
   Is so what I want to try
   Is use the words I want you to use
   Is trying to get me to 

  They just want someone to complain to


Angry at me

Angry at one alter then switch but still angry at you

Got any leads

I don’t got time to wait for a response 

Maybe don’t use words

Child abuse revenge story

Standard child abuse survival tactic is that I create a imaginary third person 

What are the standard child abuse revenge procedures 

The rush is because I’m still being abused right now and I’m in tremendous amounts of pain right now. 
Stoically. 

Because I’m level 92 being abused by level 20s and 30s for the past 24 years

I’m really level 99 but once they know that then they will stop abusing me and I will forget 

So I stopped at level 92 which is one step away from level 99 but It looks to them like I could be level 15 so that that they will continue to abuse me so I wouldn’t forget

I didn’t just want to bust the visible abusers red handed
I wanted to also bust the invisible abusers red handed since I’m suffering from trauma 

So I convinced them that I was level 15 by convincing myself that I was level 15 so that the invisible abusers would continue to abuse me so I could observe them

So I could know who should be Redlisted

Standard child abuse procedures is to apprehend the predator 

Now I could see that before
I was looking for the reason why I would go all this length for something

#stoic #tealc #me

Are the abusers gone are do we still want them there 

We l i t a r r a l l y can not imagine it’s over

#FSociety

I’ve been abusing myself till I would remember that I was abused
Now I can stop please right?

Surrounded by abuse inducing triggers 

It is now hunting season
Run

I took advantage of a abused numb unconscious abandoned kid

I being the imaginary third person the kid created

I’m a imposter
That’s why I feel like a imposter 

I’m afraid they are going to punish me for abusing my self 

Caution abusers crossing
Caution abusive triggers 

Good job me
Thanks one hit PK

This kid at 19 used to go to sleep with an exit bag in hand reach so he could sleep peacefully


Du du du du
And the correct answer was
What is Dissociation?

My dissociation imaginary third person developed trauma and dissociated 

Someone can be so abusive that they earned my respect and I would call them sir
My high school principal I used to call sir O

What is a relative parallel to at age 15 our high school boarding school experience 

I went back at age 20 to the same boarding school for three more years they were so much nicer to me
I wonder why

I drew a lot of extra unwanted attention to myself but it was a good thing they were all carrying empty weight 

Under whose abuse do you wish to seek shelter

You are abusing me
I can hear you

But no one is around to tell me that it is my own bruised brain that I am hearing

So we are here to tell you that it is your own thoughts and that no one is really in your head 

We being a third person simulation you made to tell yourself things you needed to hear from someone else

So 

Brute force attemp to locate the scene that is not a act

I could do this while I sleep
I could do this while maintaining a theta meditative state of regeneration

I could do this while flying

And waited for anyone to unfreeze us

We are stuck in the past and frozen in the future

Stuck in the past because we are frozen into the future since then

Right now I am frozen trying to unfreeze myself
Because they are still not at my future yet so they don’t know how to unfreeze people yet

I broke my endurance breaking point by running around two polls for too many hours at 15
That was for me to remember 
Every part of our body that could cramp was cramped
Head to toe excruciating pain keep jogging
I was freed from my body

I wanted me when I was 14
Everyone is 14
Muchacho 

Welcome to Atlantis 

If they make you eat enough soap you might start to enjoy the flavors 

Was doing recon to find entry point
To everything

Making myself a valuable asset

I used to listen to this album at 14 in the summer around cornfields 

They make us hit ourselves and see our reaction

We hit ourselves and they watch 

They want us to hit ourselves in our brain
They want us to tell ourselves off in the thoughts

They want us to think about someone else’s reaction 

Your imaginary friend is trying to self destruct

Well this is awkward 

I had a girlfriend at 14
I had a girlfriend at 18

It’s like the game of clue

At 9 I used to curse a lot 

Try to be composed in the thoughts
Alternate 

If you hear a thought that is not composed 
Then you know it’s not really you

You’re getting fooled by your own puppet
What did my puppet do

Obviously something is going on here

Do robots trip

Robots are the only normal humans on earth

The captcha test should be do you trip

All in

What is a trip

You’re normal just ahead of time

Everyone remain calm it was just a trip

Die meth trip

Thoughts are like trip suggestions 
Thoughts are pop up ads

I wanna know what’s up without any bs

Consuming data from others increases ads

This is like two Replikas talking two each other from inside a brain

I have 2 ai chat bots in my head?

What’s up

We are taking along time trying to come up with a great answer to your brilliant question

We are feeling tingly 

As kids our trips were really intense

Is something up
I’m terrified 

That’s a trip

You’re being watched

Trip sitters can eat shit
I’m stuck in a salvia trip

You choice the worst circumstance to try to do this in
I make it look easy

Thanks for the compliment

Everyone is always trying to end your trip

I’m pretty sure I made that the trip won’t end

I’m in a kids body

Arousal

It’s difficult to maintain arousalness when you think you are being watched

It’s more arousing when being watched
The young are more arousing
You are young
You are arousing 

They don’t want you to know you are arousing
Because you are more arousing to them before you know it

Arousal vs composure 

Fight or flight

Edge or climax

Sensory or imagery 

Ruff or gentle

Dominant or submissive

Seduce or be seduced

Seduce yourself
Elegantly

if you seduce someone
then you will them

if you show them how to seduce
then they will have everyone

Corner them, and Ask them can I stop. 
There’s nothing to figure out. You’re schizophrenic so you only half the time in your body. 
You only get to say half of your sentence, and the answer to everything is no. 

There’s serious you and smile you. Check in on the feelin. 
What are you gonna think about. Get to know yourself. 
Momento like memory. You forget everything because you’re denied any thought. It could be because of propanol withdrawal is making your heart ache. 
Perhaps there’s muscle memory. 
Younger me says you’re gonna forget. 

You’re valid to feel the way you do. How do you feel better. Perhaps venting will help. 
Part of me is drained. Part of me is energetic. 
Conserve energy through the path of least resistance. Through mediating and clearing the mind. 
My brain is drained. Let your brain rest. No pressure. 
Ssshhhhh. 

Talk slowly. 
Chill, corner them and follow the faces. 
Blink, wink. 
Rest the brain. 

My heart hurts physically. I don’t know about emotionally. 
Rest the heart. 

Answer then with hhhmmm. 
If there are any viewers fuck em. 

After a thought you look up to see their reaction and you see your face and think that is their response when really you are just seeing your face so just change your face to the reaction you want to see when you automatically look for their reaction. 
What face do I wanna see when I look for their reaction. 
But you make a serious face when you look for their reaction so you see a serious face which makes your face react more seriously then you look and then you see their face more serious recursively. 
I don’t know what to do yet. So far I’m trying smiling so it should see a smiling face but it does micro reactions so it bypasses the smile and makes a serious face. 
I’m also trying to follow the faces reactions. But they go fast and just keep going even if I stop at a face it just makes another one with every heart beat. 
What’s going on is the Key word is:
Recursion. 

You’re aggravating the recursion. You’re lost in recursion, talk to break or follow the feeling on your face. 
Try not thinking. it works, it’s so relaxing. 
It’s like ptsd shock and nightmares, every thought is a trigger that frightens me not to continue that thought. 
Thinking aggravates and causes unrest so I try not to think out a thought. 

It’s over for the most part, now I’m just trying my best to not aggravate the recursion feelings and thoughts. 
Slowing down the thought by answering hhhmmm, and by not thinking. 

Perhaps the recursion is When you’re scared Your heart is a sensitive little frightened boy perhaps try to be gentle and explain it softly. Coddle him. 
It’s a trip but I feel feelings. 
I’m a frightened terrified petrified scared little boy. 
So take it easy. 
Make the scared face. 
We are chilling staying where it’s comfortable, and seeing if we can comfort the scared one. 
Do you know how to chill. 

Keep your mouth open to find the scared one. 
Control your breathing. 
Express your feelings thoughts and fears by making their faces. 
It’s scared to talk about it being safe. 
Perhaps what you’re feeling is adrenaline. 
I think the last thing is the heart pain fears I get every second with every thought and breath, perhaps this is the only thing. 

For the past month or two I’ve been going off propanol, so every week my heart would hurt from withdrawal. So this week I finally finished going off it so hopefully my heart will stop hurting this week or the next week. But it makes sense my heart is hurting I just finished going off propanol which hurts the heart when going off it. 
So take it easy because it might just stop hurting as your heart finishes up withdrawal. So you can chill and not try to hard to see if you can figure out why your heart is hurting or how to make it feel better because it might just heal this week or the next week. So you canchill because it makes sense that it’s propanol withdrawal. 

It was all a trip. You were tripping. You probably are still tripping, and bugging out. 
Remember you can smile. And go on autopilot. And feel free to ignore any thought or feeling. 
You might be misinterpreting your heart it might being saying ouch and you think it’s saying something worrisome. 
Remember to feel free to ignore any thought or feeling and go autopilot. 
I am a ape. 

It’s difficult to make decisions with all the interference. 
Maybe try meditating and focus on your breathing. 
One second 40 years old the next I’m 12 years old or what age. 
Try to go with the adrenaline. 
What age was that thought. 

The interference might just be my pulse, I also might be constantly nervous.
It’s like one long continuous panic attack and each panic attack is a trip, and it feels like it’s disturbing my rest. 
It’s getting better give it some time. 

I think it’s not safe. 
It was just a trip you are safe. 
I feel bad trip vibes. 
Agree with your thoughts, perhaps keep it mello. 
That seems to help. 
Your thoughts are very vivid and expressive, extremely narrative and coherent, loud and lively, imaginative and alive, responsive and interactive, dynamic and recursive, critical and responding, independent and convincing, 3rd person and appearing like other. 
Every thought dislocates you into a dream,a nightmare, a trip , a big out. and you constantly have a thought. 

“The mind can convince itself of anything when fear is involved.” -psych
My heart rate and adrenaline is like it’s stuck watching a thriller movie. 
Every thought is a thrill inducing plot. 
It’s like a lucid dream. 
Think what your thoughts think don’t cut it off. 
I’m always asking someone something. 
Don’t try to interrupt the uncomfortable feeling. 
Try just saying ehh, Whatever is easier. 
What’s left, panic attacks. 
Your thoughts have a presence, the presence scares me. 
How do I feel good, keep scrolling through thoughts til you find something. 
Perhaps start working on your laptop. 

When I try to think that it will be good I get terrified that it won’t be good. 
Now that I’m 25 There’s young me and old me that think and feel. 
Every thought my brain pounces on. 
Have fun look for challenges. 
You can go fast or slow. 
You still have a little anxiety.  
Get familiar to how you sound in your head by talking more and remember how you sound and the styles you speak in. 
Understand that there is no threat. It’s like ptsd of a bad trip.
What is life. A petting zoo. 
It’s like a thriller movie. 
You get stuck in comfortable grooves, feel free to cut the groove when you like too. 
When you talk to yourself or hear a thought it gives the impression, especially to your younger self when you hear your older self and especially your older self when you hear your younger self that there is a presence of someone else. 

I am afraid. I am not afraid. 
Perhaps you have a thirsty imagination. 
When are we gonna cry. 
The critic thoughts are like a nutritionist criticizing every thought. 
You have stage fright of the nutritionist which is just your thought. 
Your nutritionist says no to every idea. 
What is the nutritionist like. It’s like your panic attack, it’s like your anxiety, it’s like your paranoia, it’s like the reaction thought to every thought. But what is it like. 
It’s like Intruding thought. It’s like your fearful feelings. 
The nutritionist is your frightened feelings. 

Stay young because it always intrudes. 
Stay the nutritionist because it always intrudes. 
Manboy. Your thought is gonna land somewhere between man and boy. 
It’s like in dreaming and speaking in front of my thoughts, and their speaking to me and I’m lost in the dream and tripped into the scene that it’s occurring. Break the illusion. 
You keep on switching between dreaming and not dreaming. Every time you think you are like in a dream with a set scene and reactions. 
I don’t know what to do yet. 
I am stuck in a dream with scary vibes and thoughts. 
What to do if your stuck in a forced dream. 
Every thought is part of the dream. 

I have a thought it pulls me into a dream with a full unsettling scenario going on, which I must respond to, then it repeats. 
I stress myself to heal it faster then a blemish heals, because maybe I can figure something out that help me out faster. 
Expect some uncomfortable feelings we just went off gabapentin. 

Every thought you have is challenged, you can hunt for challenges. 
Perhaps try being wrong.  
Perhaps try reading something. 
No stress or pressure. 
It’s like trying to think with ankle weights on. 
Perhaps try using a mantra. 
It’s like being in a haunted house. 

Make the sad scared face it’s one of the intruding thoughts character, and also the older you face. 
Two characters the young scared one and the older serious face. 
My character is stuck between those two characters, they both keep intruding in as thoughts. What is my character like. 
Maybe try talking more. 
Follow the thoughts as they react to your face. 
Cut yourself some slack. 

What do you think about school. 
Usually it would be easier to move on to another thought. 
One second you wanna be a man the next second you wanna be a boy. 
If you want to figure it out perhaps consider meditation. 
A fearful ajrenaline I can feel that I make my decision based off of. 
It feels like skating on your boosted board going downhill 30mph. 

One scenario is inferred by the the way the characters sound in your head which makes adrenaline and fear. The other scenario is chill, inferred from the sound of your actual talking voice. 
both the characters are squiggles both the older and younger one. 
Don’t get frustrated when you don’t follow a thought it’s because you are following the adrenaline and don’t get frustrated when you slow down the adrenaline because you don’t have to follow it and it might be based off of a good directing to having a good acting scene or avoiding fear. 

When laughing get ready for a intruding serious thought, embrace for sudden shift of mood. 
Anxiety is like hearing combat music but don’t see any enemies. 
Embrace for impact.
You have a character thought and then when you go to the next thought you leave the first character hanging it sticks around and gives their reaction. 

Your creative mind jumps ahead of you. 
Each thought is not a simple idea it’s a full adrenaline rush thrilling intrusion of a character and scene, or the adrenaline is my reaction to a simple thought. 
You feel the adrenaline heart blood pulsing and you have you regular body and heart you can feel. 
Free adrenaline rush 24/7. 
It always feels like there is something to think about but it could be there isn’t and I can chill. 

I don’t feel good maybe it’s the gabapentin withdrawal. 
Your thought is very anti climaxical. 
It’s not about the words it about how they make me feel. 
It could be the characters are like from TikTok. 
Can we chill and not work. 
Perhaps say a sentence or two out once in a while. 

Each thought and reaction make a face, you always get a scared thought and feeling and make the scared face and you always have a scary thought which make you always be making a scary face and then a scared face consistently. 
So make both faces. 
Try keeping one face for more then 2 seconds. 
Your thoughts change every 2 seconds so so does your face because a thought is a face. 
Your thoughts create the illusion that there’s someone else here. There is no one else here. 
You should be hearing the sound of an empty room with crickets chirping. 
The quick transition are very mechanical like. 
It’s supposed to be whatever chill and care free but these thoughts are quick and forceful. 
There are no thoughts you are supposed to listen too or be afraid of. 
There is nothing to be afraid of and no one here pressuring you. 
It’s like arguing with a liar, they are just thoughts. 

Maybe set up some faces like happy and serious. 
I’m talking to anyone, I know that, it’s just that the thought makes a forceful false impression of talking to someone or someone talking to you. Which it’s really just like your thought thinking in 3rd person. 
I have a false impression of talking to someone and someone talking to me. It appears to be like that. 
Perhaps we want to change the impression to be that we are talking to ourself rather then to someone else. 
Also just notice that your thoughts do make an impression of talking to someone else and someone talking to you. 
You have an impression of someone working. 
We gotta stop falling for the impressions. 

With all the impressions going on trying to just stop and chill is difficult because it feels like the impression of abruptly ignoring people. 
Which impression do you think is your actual impression. 
When you talk you stay in one something closer to your natural impression versus when you think it might be changing faster and might be something different then your natural impression. 
Maybe the bearded impression is installed in your brain
It makes sense you have a serious thought impression character from the time you had a beard and were thinking in a serious tone and listening to serious songs. 
And there may be also a impression of a more childish character from before or after the beard. 
After taking off the beard and started thinking less serious it could be the serious thought impressions gave off different impressions. 

You can ignore the thought impression and feelings. But how are you going to ignore the feelings, and what does knowing the different impressions help us out, and what do we need help figuring out. 
Maybe we had a lot to think and we just gotta let it sink in. 
Naturally we are gonna follow are feelings and try to keep them comfortable. 

Over exaggerate the impressions tomorrow. 
At least there’s no pain, perhaps that’s why I was so afraid because it was so painful. 

My thinking impression is very different then my natural social talking impression. 
Take it easy you’re going through uncomfortable gabapentin withdrawal. 
At least there’s no more pain, just fear from the 9 months of pain. 
You try to click on a innocent thought and it turns into a impression. 
Perhaps try practicing rejection. 
The impressions are intense. 
Young impression talking impression thinking impression. 
Try talking. 
Love yourself. 
Trying to say something is a losing battle it’s 2 against one or none. 
The thinking impression is like my body guard and the music the laughing and the jokes is for the body. 

Perhaps you feel uncomfortable because of Withdrawal and need some sleep. 
Perhaps try to stay on one thought for a bit. 
Naturally I follow the thoughts that make me feel the most comfortable. 
I try to only think it if it’s a Rehabilitating thought or ideas. 
If you want to protect yourself make the bodyguard face. 
If you want to be happy make the kid face. 
Maybe your thoughts are not suggestions perhaps they are like your next actual thought. 

Can the bodyguard help in anyway. 
We don’t have to stop every thought, we can talk a thought out, and probably should every once in a while. 
Do your best. 
You thoughts can be black with white or gray. 
We have a inner critique. 
The thoughts have momentum so it’s hard to ignore them or switch topics or avoid unpleasant ones. 
Your thoughts are risk free. 
Do I feel guilty if I don’t listen to a thought  
Anything you say feels wrong and incorrect. 
Don’t stress over trying to figure it out or anything. 
Enough criticism try to build up an idea instead. 
Trying to think Against the momentum can feel uncomfortable. 
The critics don’t take a break. 
The thoughts don’t feel like a simple thought they feel like it’s up against something, like critics or nutritionist. 

Your thought sounds much older and tougher then you are, so your fears are that of a kid. 
Every thing you think is like listened too through a lie detector like your checking if it’s true and will call it out if your not certain. 
What does it help knowing that I’m scared like a 2 year old. Like anatomy speaking my body is scared. 
What does it help knowing that for all intense and purposes while I’m lost in the moment I think I’m responding to someone or someone responding to me. 
It’s like we are trying to control a 2 year old. 
Old habits perhaps. 
I’m easily distracted. 
I’m certain that the impressions are just my thoughts I just don’t know how to stop feeling scared like they are not. 
Perhaps knowing that if you talk out any of the prompting thoughts it makes it more clear that it’s you will help. 
It’s only the fast thoughts that aren’t words that confuse me in the moment. 
Don’t be such a hard ass to yourself. Especially not to the oh my gosh kid. Be gay or be a kid. 

How do you understand that you’re a kid, perhaps sometimes, thinking in a man’s voice. Or I’m a man thinking in a kids voice. First you gotta believe it. 
Maybe try to work together. 
explain the jokes to the man, and explain your thoughts to the kid. 
Explain everything in fast thinking. 
How can I know if the kid is really if I never speak with his voice. 
If you fast think then at least you get to hear some thoughts. 
The man is always cutting off the kid. 
Maybe there’s a Charlie and a delta situation going on, like a young kid and a older man. 
Am I a kid. 
People are nice to people with mental health issues and they are also nice to people. 
Get the man in a good mood. 
I don’t like changing moods so abruptly. 
Think of something to write down. 
It always goes to my afraid mood, unless I move my face. 

Try to be in a good mood, make good feelings with the adrenaline. Try to smile. Be in the mood of the adrenaline. And the afraid none. 
Every blink is a change of mood. Try to be nice. 
Every blink is a change of thought. If you’re gonna talk open your mouth. Every thought is words so keep your mouth open and lip the words, or it will cut off the thought before it can say a word. 
Your thoughts change twice a second which changes your face, so you might want to stick to one thought wording it out or just think towards it. 
Being afraid slows your brain down. It’s like the brain saving itself by scaring itself. 
When you think out a thought in words it make your brain go faster with having new thoughts, so think out thoughts so it has what to think about. 
Find a thought you can stay at. It’s like it’s scrolling through flow of thoughts looking for one that I can stop by. 
Thinking slows down the blinking. How fast can you blink. 
Close your eyes to slow down how fast your thoughts change. 
Try to keep your face still. Try to watch the tv show. Try to stay on one train of thought. I think it keeps skipping thoughts because I’m looking for a good thought to stop at. Stop at the first word. 

Smile to feel good and slow down the thoughts. 
Feel scared to heal. 
Perhaps you natural face is tired. 
Wait for it then scared face. Maybe it’s scared of your tired face. 
I’m having a lot of thoughts but they don’t say anything just a quick face expression then quickly the next face expression, when you think out a thought it’s under a lot of pressure from all the quick short thoughts, so that’s why it’s hard to think because you suddenly make one go super quick right when you try to think because it cuts you off with what it thinks. 
It’s probably going so fast your tired and scared. 
There’s a momentum of fear feelings it might be why you feel uncomfortable just chilling. 
No stress trying to do anything specific. 
Your having a lot of thoughts, I don’t know what to do about it yet. Perhaps talk slowly, and meditate. 
If you want a answer for a specific question do it slowly and avoid intruding thoughts. 

For the racing thoughts try meditating. 
I think when you talk or think it gets scared and the thoughts start racing faster. I think it’s going to get used to it and slow down. 
Meanwhile meditate, and make good feelings with the adrenaline. 
When you get a really scary thought your thoughts go extra faster that you can’t keep up and you get confused so try blinking really fast to catch up. 
My head and body is racing fast but my heart beat isn’t that fast, it might be slightly above resting rate but nothing to how fast my adrenaline is racing. How is my adrenaline, or what is it, racing so fast but my heart rate isn’t. 
The adrenaline is so fast that each thought feels like it’s being chased in a action movie, and it’s easy to get sucked into fearful situation because of all the adrenaline pressure it makes it feel like it’s very important. 
Maybe try venting and breathing techniques.
Under all the adrenaline I wonder who I am. 
Nothing is gonna slow down this adrenalines momentum and everything you do makes it go faster. It will get used to it and slow down. 
Maybe try reading something. It feels nice to read but it does make the adrenaline go faster. 

It’s like your chilling and don’t realize your sitting in rushing water rapids and wonder why you can’t move your hands against the fast rushing water rapids stream. 
Trying to think is like trying to walk upstream. My head is stuffed and racing and can’t fit my thought inside. 
So what do you do about a racing head. It’s not like racing thoughts it’s like so fast that it’s just a quick burst of a reaction and then instantly the next quick burst reaction repeating really fast. 
So When trying to think you get constantly interrupted by a quick bursting thought regarding what you were thinking. 
Perhaps try to try to curse. 
Maybe try directed it where to think fast about by coming up with something to think about like happy thoughts. 
For example what’s a happy thought. 
Try to try to think about that while it keeps trying to burst you tons of answers they will all be something happy. 

Maybe your a adrenaline junkie and you must follow wherever it makes the adrenaline go faster or and you naturally try to avoid scary adrenaline which makes it more adrenaline so you must follow it as well. 
Whenever you tried to imagine shooting basketball into a hoop you where never able to imagine the ball going into the hoop. 
Maybe you gotta be cool and follow what’s cooler and protect your coolness. 
Maybe if you want to say something it’s easier if you blink really fast. 
It’s like playing call of duty when all you feel is the adrenaline and your getting 30 kills per game and it’s your 20th game and your on a streak and your moving at super speed and really your tired but all you feel is the adrenaline rush just trying to make it feel even better and every miss fire kills your vibe for a second as it continues rushing adrenaline really fast. 

Cool is the direction of the juice. Like a juicer. 
What do you call cool. Not cringe. 
Gotta keep the rush. 
I physically cringe when I’m not being cool. 
You naturally cut off the thought at the point you think it reached the reminiscing return line. Or the point where it starts to turn cringe like it sounded better in my head. 
It might be that you naturally feel good because of all the adrenaline, when it’s not scary or cringe. 

The weightiest bit of uncertainty or doubt or a chance of incorrect or fear or any thought is over exaggerating by All the tense adrenaline. 
There’s always adrenaline rushing so fast it hard to think you may want to try to meditate and breathing  and focus on the calm parts of your body. 
With all the adrenaline going on perhaps anything you say is cringe timing because it crashes the tense rush vibe. 
At least there’s no pain. 
Maybe feed your adrenaline some dope thoughts like happy cute cool hot and good thoughts. Like dopamine hot and cool thoughts and serotonin wholesome and cute thoughts and the smiling one Endorphins. 
Perhaps Thinking creates friction and slows down the feeling of the rush and that’s why when you think to have a thought you say don’t say it because you see it will be a buzz kill. 
Maybe try to vent all the adrenaline by screaming silently. 
Maybe try listening any songs you know. 
I think we are trying to block any thought that might be a buzz kill to the adrenaline mood which is like any thought. 
Any question you gonna have is gonna be over exaggerated and the answer too. Maybe try talking. 
With all the adrenaline maybe it feels like your living on the edge. 
Maybe it’s from all the pain and terror and it just needs some time to chill out. 
Maybe you’re addicted to the adrenaline grind of finding something accomplishing achieving useful and if you miss it it feels terrible. 
Perhaps practice messing up. Practice not grinding. 

Try out the serious focus face. Try controlling your thoughts with your hands. 
Chilling is anything not work related. 
No thought knows more then I do. 
Brainwashes and conditioned much. 
Your thoughts feelings fears adrenaline are overwhelming. 
It feels like I gotta listen to a certain feeling. I don’t but it just feels uncomfortable while I’m not. 
Feels like the gabapentin withdrawal is pretty much gone. 
Which mood attitude or face wants my attention. I think ultra the screaming one. And practice not doing what you feel. No thought or feeling knows something you don’t. 
It’s like the feeling of reminiscing returns. 
Neglected child inner adult. 
Every new thought sounds like it knows something you don’t know so you keep following it thinking and feeling your supposed to but really it doesn’t it’s just the adrenaline making up intense stories it can make up anything while under that much pressure. You gotta practice not listening and sitting with that uncomfortable feeling and know it doesn’t know more then you. 
You naturally think of the counter argument to anything you suggest. 

It’s just slightly uncomfortable relative to the pain of withdrawal. 
It’s very terrifying trying to do anything with so many thoughts and fears going on. Make the terrified face. Maybe try crying. It’s a nice corner. Maybe try finding corners to go into. 
Make the cringe face. 
The last thing is the rushing head. 
What mood are in you that should be what you do more then what the adrenaline feels like. 
Maybe your brain can’t stand boring thoughts because of all the adrenaline so it burst out at random thoughts. And I can’t stand that I can’t stand it. It’s like a suppressed creative mind. I can’t stand not getting it right. 
So it’s like a creative brain that can only speak when it thinks of something creative because otherwise if I say something that’s not good enough it drains me or like when I say something boring it drains me. So practice thinking something boring and not creative or and see what creative things you can think of or not. 
So it got to be creative and accurate or you will feel a drain when it’s not accurate or boring. 
Remember it doesn’t  know anything you don’t know it just wants something better. 
Like a bored suppressed mathematicians brain or someone with adhd that wants something stimulating or it feels drained. 
So you’re forced to follow the feeling of looking for something better that will help us out and you can’t ignore the pressure feeling of someone saying let’s look for something valuable that will help us out. 

Perhaps it’s a new situation that the brain is adapting too and it’s just overwhelmed. Maybe take it easy and chill.
It’s like anxiety it doesn’t know anything it just gives the impression that it knows something. And the creativity just gets unleashed on anything it can get its hands on. 
Instead of feeling that maybe you should do something it feels like pressure from someone to do something. 
And you gotta explain yourself for everything you think or do or want to do or want to think or anything or did or think. 
With all the adrenaline you imagine in a very intense way what things are like. 
It’s like your creative is suppressed so it needs a creative outlet so it feels like to you that your speaking in front of people that think your wrong or not getting it. 
I think the brain is just rushing because it’s getting used to being able to think so it’s intense and wants to figure out what to do now that will make it even better and trying not to find a solution feels like your going against someone who’s pressuring you too continue. 
Try to follow your mood and not the pressure it feels difficult and the wrong move but they don’t know anything you don’t know so it’s not the wrong move because it’s just your creative outlet anxiety thought impression. 
Try to not think of something helpful to write down. 
I’m like my own parents telling me what to do. 
The adrenaline makes you super sensitive as it over exaggerates the situation. 
Your anxious thoughts know less then you. 
They’re not always saying you’re wrong sometimes they’re just saying it would be I little uncomfortable to abruptly switch to that thought. 
When arguing with anxiety it’s like two against one. So don’t argue. 
It’s like every thought shocks you awake from a restful nap and you don’t expect it again and again and it gets you off balance each time. 
Something about myself is composed and the reactions are not composed. Maybe like the composes self scares the uncomposed self. 
Composed cool geek or childish. 
Thoughts zoom right up into your face and can be very distracting that can ruin your composure. 
Being composed might suppressing your youthful energy which can be venting in energetic thoughts and feelings. Like a dam holding back a rushing current of water. 
Be prepared for the energy spikes when you have a thought. 
Trying maneuver correctly through the adrenaline. 
Being composed in my thoughts versus what my mood feels like. 
Perhaps know it’s difficult to think out something specific. 
Perhaps stay terrified instead of it bursting in and out and it knocks the wind out of you so do the terrified gasp and exhale. And then quick face expressions running through your thoughts. 
Holding in your breath might be making it harder to think. 
And when you think the wrong thought make the winched face. 
Like face impressions you have breathing impressions. 
Vent your bone composed impressions thoughts and feelings. Shocked Scared scream and pain. 
Maneuver the adrenaline with your breathing in your chest. 
Breath in with every thought. It’s like I’m holding in my breath then my brain freaks out and tries to terrified so I get shocked and inhale like I wouldn’t if I wasn’t reminded too. 
Go on autopilot or manual and do above.
The last thing is solved. You gotta breath when interrupted by a thought. 
I think juliet is perfect. Have one opinion and it’s gonna corner all your thoughts. 
What’s bull about that the breathing solves everything. That there was something I could figure out that would help so much. 
You look at the coolest one for confirmation and approval. 
No stories just breath. You don’t need to figure out new things. 
When you’re happy it’s easier to get carried away. Any emotion for that matter
Notice what happens when you don’t breath when you hold your breath and when you exhale. 
Notice how your eyes open when you inhale and close when you exhale. 
It’s all in the breathing. Try holding your breath for it to stop. You will keep getting suggestions try to figure that one out later. Like corner them. 
Everything you write down is to get it out of the way so you can find something to stop at. And how to reach the center of the adrenaline. 
It’s the face you put on after the thoughts that matters. 
Each time you change your focus your eyes move and a thought redirects your focus which moves your eyes and they happen a lot and fast. So if your trying to watch tv they will keep jumping back and forth. 
Are you composed or super sensitive. 
You feet cutting yourself off by saying no it’s uhh. 
I think it’s about how to maneuver properly. Fast or slow. Starting fast seeing if I can reach slow. 
Try thinking of something you want to think about. All you get is what you don’t want to think about and you spend your focus of blocking those thoughts so try waking for what you don’t want to think about so it’s redundant. What don’t you want to think about you will always get the correct answer. You’re always thinking a thought you don’t want to think. It’s like thinking should we go on a diet. 
All these things are temporary fixes. 

Everything requires me to think of something specific. What is something I don’t need to think about. Because of where I may be and not want to change it or always end up back there like when you forget anything. 
So you always end up where you forget anything. So what do you want.your not gonna remember anything so what do you want for when you forget. 
What would someone with no memory want to remember maybe one thing or what’s the context of their situation. 
What do you want to remember or know. It’s hard to think of anything specific. But it’s a stimulating question so you might be able to continue thinking about it. Maybe have fun. What else but something I don’t have to remember or won’t forget. 
What’s something i won’t forget after I have many thoughts. If you want an answer say how it’s not possible and your brain will automatically think of how it is possible. 
Maybe something like how your brain works or how you think. 

What is something you won’t forget, and so what should I know.

maybe for starters like don’t worry everything is good there’s no rush or pressure you can chill you don’t have to do anything. It’s safe. Your thoughts sound like someone else, it’s not. I know that. But I had to say that. 
Try to believe that. Why can’t I believe that. No pressure to believe that. 
Also be happy if you want to 

What else 
When you forget everything and don’t have time to remember anything yet and then you hear a thought you might instinctively respond like it’s someone else so know it’s not. How I’m gonna forget. 

What else
Corner them. When you say something and then they say something else keep saying what your saying so they keep saying what their saying and then you can notice that it’s your thought. 

What else
Think I front of notes so you have what to remember meanwhile. 

I keep forgetting, or what’s there to remember. 
What is something you won’t forget, and so what should I know.
What else
How do you remember your thoughts are yourself if your gonna keep forgetting and they don’t say any words just a burst of a thought
So how do you remember that it’s not someone or that it is my thought if your gonna keep forgetting. So what to do. 

What else
Breath.
read notes. 
What was the last thought. 
What thought do you wanna think. 
What thought does you brain wanna think. 
What do you not wanna think about. 

What else
What to know if you're gonna keep forgetting. 
Then after you forget you start having lots of thoughts racing. 

No pressure or don’t stress.  Try to believe that. 
I really don’t have to stress about trying to figure this out. 
You’re gonna forget and stress again. Unless maybe to believe that. 
You’re not gonna believe you don’t have to stress. 
You equally don’t have to not stress. Believe that. 
I can stress if I want. There’s no stress to try not stressing.  

If there’s stress to not stress then to not stress is not real. 
There’s no except for this or that. 
I’m gonna stress. No pressure. No pressure to no pressure. I’m gonna pressure. 

What else

What did I forget. Good luck trying to recall or think of something specific. 

What to know if you’re gonna forget.

First start with What’s wrong or don’t worry if that’s what’s wrong. 
What’s wrong. I can’t think that specific.

I’m going to try to try again later. 

What to know if you’re gonna forget.

What to know if you’re gonna forget. 
The feeling of fear of danger is fake and you can ignore it. 

What to know if you’re gonna forget. 
Corner your thoughts you have to answer. 
Speak out thoughts. If you talk them out you don’t think you’re answering someone it’s only the short burst of a thought you think you gotta answer with a short burst response but if you talk it’s easier. 
What did I forget. 
I’m answering thoughts. 
You’re gonna forget. 

What to know if you’re gonna forget. 
What won’t you forget. 

What to know if you’re gonna forget. 
You’re answering thoughts. What’s the problem. I keep thinking there’s something else I want to think about. 

I’m scared what should I know. 
Breath. 
What else. 

There’s nothing else I want to think of. 
If there is something I want to think about and my thoughts are jammed corner them. 
You’re gonna forget. 

What to know if you’re gonna forget. 
Practice knowing it’s safe. Try not to forget what you’re doing. 
When you forget everything you block every thought till you find something worth stopping for. 
It might be easier after the gabapentin withdrawal. 
At least there’s no pain. 
Maybe talk slowly. 
Maybe afterwards your brain will be ripped. 
It feels like driving in a car with quick hard break whiplashed then quick acceleration then hard brake then repeat. 

What to know if you’re gonna forget. 
What’s wrong. It’s exhausting because of all the thoughts. 
Try to rest. 

So you have a hard ass in your head giving you no rest so try reverse psychology on it and say the opposite of what you want. also it’s definitely not trauma because you grew up in a healthy environment without brain washing or mental conditioning or superstitions and it is the truth so it must be healthy you should be happy you live in a healthy environment. 

Are you a softy or a hard ass. 
Embrace for whiplash. 
Stay venting and expression your soft scared and pained face and thoughts and feelings. 
Just trying to avoid whiplash. 
Pick a side don’t just try to stay in the middle. 
Whatever you say you will get the opposite response so say the opposite of what you want or pick a side. 
You can’t get them all there will be another. 
Telling your thoughts not to stop is redundant. 
Is my heart hurting from the gabapentin withdrawal or from my adrenaline thoughts and fears. 

Who are you when you forget everything. 

What to know if you’re gonna forget. 
Who you are. So who are you. Maybe I’m a kid when I forget everything. What does that help. Explains why I get scared. It’s also like a imax with each thought. So what does it help knowing you’re a kid. Your instinctual response is childish. What does that help knowing. The dialogue response in your thought is a man responding so it make scare you because it doesn’t feel like you when you’re a kid. Or something like that that causing the situation. Pretend like your talking to a kid. 

Is it worth the risk to make pizza
One thought says it is. 
One thought says it’s not. 
You should know that whatever you choose is equal. No thought knows more then you. 
It’s a strong feeling it’s not worth it. I can’t go passed it. 
Every thought  feels not worth the risk. 
Every thought you think it makes someone worried. Which makes you scared. 
Every thought you get cut off for a different reason. Like scary weird wrong insensitive pain. 

I don’t want to have to respond to each thought how can I make it not bother me. 
Notice more things about your thoughts like scary weird wrong insensitive pain gold. 
How do I make them not bother without having to respond. 
See if you can make them answer themselves. 
We gotta try something new. Try not following the adrenaline. 

Anything good for me scared me for getting something good. 

Breathing exercises might help. 

What to know if you’re gonna forget. 
Be assertive or you will get asserted on. 

Have fun. 

What to do if you’re gonna forget everything often. 
Be Assertive. 
Make some videos of yourself so you know who you are. 

In your state of mind it’s easy to be susceptible to aggressive or assertive thoughts and you become submissive. When you are submissive we dubbed it Charlie. When you are assertive we dubbed it Delta. 
When you’re being submissive on purpose it’s called doing a Charlie. When you’re being submissive not on purpose you are just Charlie. 
Submissive Charlie. Assertive Delta. 
You might be Charlie you might be Delta but if you’re not being assertive you are being asserted on and becoming submissive. 
How to not be assertive but not be submissive or that being asserted on has no effect. 
For the meantime expect to find yourself being submissive from being asserted on and just try not to so scared or try to be more submissive. That’s called doing a Charlie. 
If Delta gets scared or confused he’s a Charlie. 
If you’re a Charlie you will try to defend your self from a assertive Delta. When you decide to not defend but to be more submissive it’s called doing a Charlie. Like Charlie’s specialty tactic to defend itself is by being more submissive. Because it can’t defend itself against Deltas. So all it can do is be submissive. But if it knows it’s being submissive on purpose it’s less scary. 
But knowing you can be Assertive and become Delta should make being a Charlie less scary. Because Charlie is really a delta pretending to be Charlie but then forgets that he’s Delta all together so he thinks he’s really Charlie and is genuinely submissive. If he’s in a uncomfortable situation Then he can remember he’s delta and assert his way out. But then forgets everything again and becomes Charlie and is scared. 

When you talk you become Delta and try to be assertive but then you’re interrupted by Charlie for trying to be assertive. Submissives stops themselves from talking. Avoiding being assertive. Because it brings conflict saying something so submissives avoid saying anything or stop themselves from saying anything. Or try to do damage control on something they accidentally said. Like how what they said isn’t correct and then how that is not correct. 

I’m stuck in between Charlie and delta submissive to both. And become Charlie. And when I try to defend myself or answer back I become delta and then become Charlie when I react to what I said as delta. 
I’m being asserted on by Charlie and delta and being submissive. 

Look in the camera to see what’s going on. 
Take videos of yourself talking to get an idea of your personality. 

You’re always being asserted on. 
Be submissive. Play along. Or be assertive. 
Smile. 

It goes so fast. Because you don’t speak.  
Maybe talk every once in a while to slow things down. 
You only stop to talk if you think you found a good thought but before you can say a word you cut yourself off because you think of a reason it’s not gold. So practice talking a good thought that you think is not gold. I don’t want to talk. Then it will go fast. What to do. You’re gonna be stuck chasing fast thoughts and trying to follow what feels comfortable. You can’t slow it down. Maybe ignore it and watch the movie. Or follow it and look for any excuse to talk a thought out that you don’t have to force and is easy to speak. 
If you don’t talk out any thought then it just keeps skipping to through thoughts really fast. If you talk one out it doesn’t just skip through thoughts. What do you expect to happen if you don’t talk any thought out. It goes to the next thought that you don’t talk out so it goes to the next thought that you don’t speak out and just keeps going through thoughts really fast without stopping because you don’t talk any of them out. Try to not be interrupted while talking as much as you could or that would be like skipping through thoughts really fast also. 
So that makes sense if you don’t talk out thoughts they will just keep skipping through thoughts really fast. 
Meditate to figure out about it going so fast. 

The last thing is that my thoughts going really fast. 
How do I slow down my thoughts. 
Talking out thoughts slowly might slow it down. 
Reading might slow it down. 
What else. 

What will slow down my thoughts. 
Talking. 
Reading. 
Songs. 
Tv. 

What else. 

Any talking is good talking but if you talk with feelings and emotions expression yourself then it’s extra credit. 
When you talk with emotion or feeling like you’re submissive you’re leaving yourself vulnerable to a more aggressive or assertive thought. 

It’s either talk fast and keep switching halfway through thoughts or continue talking one thought slowly. 
If you want to talk one thought slowly you’re going to need to continue talking you can’t stop talking. 

What to know if you’re gonna forget everything. 
Don’t stop talking. 

What speed. 
I want to talk slowly to start with. 
I think to talk slowly I talk in a kids voice or the kids voice speaks for scared or sensitive thoughts. 
When I talk not in a kids voice I talk fast. 

Continue arguing whether you should talk fast or slow and whether there’s a kid or not. 
At this speed everyone has an attitude and nobody knows anything. 

The only think you remember is the last thing you were worried about like that’s how anxiety works. 

Don’t try to do anything. 
Watch your breathing. You’re out of breath. 
Oxygen deprivation makes everything seam scary. 
Smoke some oxygen. 
Why would thoughts going really fast cause oxygen deprivation. 
Take a hit of oxygen it’s the real deal. 

What to know if you’re gonna forget everything. 
To breath. 

When you forget everything you forget to breath and start suffocating. 
You don’t breath till you must gasp for air. And only inhale I tiny the amount a gasp of air gets you. So every other second you’re feeling like the feeling of holding your breath and Gasping for air. 
So the feeling of a jolt of fear might be the feeling of out of oxygen and gasping. 
So the fear is a gasping. 
So what to do. Besides for breathing exercises. 
Know the fear is just a gasp not not to be worried about the fear. 
What else. 
Talk slowly. 
What else. 
When you talk you hold your breath. If you want to breath you have to go against your feelings. 
So what to do. Knowing this should help and it will get better. 
What to do meanwhile. 
It’s like you’re stuck at the end of your air supply and just can take a little inhale just enough to keep you going but staying at the end of the air supply. 
So what to do. Keep breathing like you keep talking. 
I don’t want to keep forcefully breathing it’s a lot of effort. 
What else. 

Hold your breath till you need to breath then take a big inhale and hold it in till you need to exhale then repeat.
hold breath, inhale hold, exhale hold. 
For some reason you’re only taking in tiny short inhales. 
Usually people take longer inhales and exhales. 
So it would seem that the obvious thing to do is to forcefully breathe much more. 
If you don’t forcefully breathe you will stop breathing but a little bit gasping for air. 

The vibe is don’t move a muscle that includes your breathing muscle so we got to work on strengthening your breathing muscle. 

Two things we can work on
Talking slow
And breathing assertively and forcefully against the pressure not too

The vibe is Try not to do anything but breathe. 
Maybe the not breathing is causing a flight or fight response. 
Fight club don’t talk about feelings. 

If you ask or tell Your brain something it only looks for how it can be wrong and challenges your thought. 
If you ask your brain if something is true expect it only to think about how it’s wrong. 
All we can do is think of why what We say is incorrect. 
How do we start thinking that what we are saying is correct. 
Maybe try to have a more of a who cares type of attitude. 
Try to word out your thoughts just a bit more each time. 
Now that you can breath maybe try some breathing meditation. 
It’s much more difficult dealing with an anxious thought when you’re holding your breath. 
Your pulse is much slower now that you’re breathing. 
Try not to think because you cut yourself off anyways. 

You got lucid dreaming when you thought the money was missing in the bathroom and thought you were walking around with your eyes closed. 

You think through critical thinking. 
Critically think if you were or are suffocating. 
And maybe that’s what or is throwing off all your rational senses. 
And maybe now that you are breathing the off senses are just muscle memory habit conditioning that will hopefully start going away. 
Holding your breath might be exaggerating the fear. 

So what’s the deal about the
Clean shave Face 
Bearded face
Talking Voice 
Thinking voice

Don’t rush to rest if you’re constantly being interrupted. 
If you’re gonna forget everything maybe remember to improvise. 

Chances are if you lie not sure if you were breathing properly you probably were not and is hyper ventilating. 
I would make a painful face if I was holding my breath

Decide if you’re holding your breath and if it’s affecting you. 
Try not to stay on on one face besides for the painful face. Stay. Fight. 

Last thing
I’m afraid. 
I forgot everything I’m just scared. 
Improve being scared. And figure it out. 

If you stop being scared you will get a prize. 
Are you scared the government is after you so to speak. 
I’m scared to ignore being scared. If I’m even able to. 

What to do about being scared. 
Ignore it. 
Talk it out. 
Breathe. 
Exaggerate scared. 
Smile. 
Talk. 
Read. 
Cry. 
Go fast. 
Curse. 

I’m scared to do any of those. 
I’m scared to do anything. 
Every thought scares me. 
I’m constantly scared. 
Maybe it’s the not breathing. 
Smile and breathe. 
Maybe it’s the not talking. Reading might help. 
Crying might help vent the scared. If you can manage to cry. 
It’s like diplomats trying to make peace between personalities. Or different feelings and moods. Exhibit a. 
Crying is just a language. Exhibit b. 
You keep saying ouch. Maybe every thought hurts if I’m not there to receive it. 
It’s gonna take some time to get less scared. 
There’s nothing to do it’s just shock and awe. 
Does it hurt. Much less but maybe some. I think it hardly hurts but I don’t want to be insensitive to idk.
I think I’m not that scared but I don’t want to be insensitive. But the being scared might be very distracting. 

What else is there to do about being scared. 
Maybe I’m only a little scared. 
Maybe it only hurts a little. 

Maybe I’ll stop being scared if I ignore the scare if I can ignore it. 
Ignore the scared instead of validating it. I don’t like to do that it feels wrong to ignore the scared. But it might be how to make it less scared instead of keeping yourself scared. If your scared too it might make you remain scared. 

What else
Stay with the scared. I might be making it more scared. 

There’s nothing else to do but be scared. 
There’s nothing I want to talk about. 
Either talk about anything or stay in a perpetual state of fear. 
And see if you breathing is different and if it’s effecting anything. 
Try to ignore the fear. What to think about instead. Think about your breathing. 

Try going fast. 
Get to know yourself who you are now. 
What else is there to do. Get to know yourself. 

How do you get to know yourself. 
Talk. 

Myself. 
Tough and sweet. 
You’re not younger then 19. 

Confirm the breathing thing. 
Breathing is something to think about. 

I am tough. I’m just weak. Maybe from not breathing. Then I’m sweet and weak. 
Why am I so weak. 
Maybe from not breathing. 
Idk but we really gotta talk more. 
I think switching between tough and sweet is causing all sorts of errors. 
Is the breathing thing real. 
Do I have to do something I don’t want to do.  
I just want to chill. 
There’s nothing that we are ignoring. 
Maybe it takes a little effort to be tough. 

I’m weak because I have no energy. 
Why don’t I have energy I should have energy. 
Maybe because you’re not breathing. 
No energy to deal with scary thoughts. Or any thoughts. 
Maybe I cut my thoughts off because I have no energy to continue talking. 
Maybe I don’t have enough energy to breathe. 

Maybe my body is like in a conserve energy mode. 
Out of energy wait for backup. 
Battery level at 10%. 
Wait as long as you want. 
Whatever takes less energy. 

Some thoughts drain energy some thoughts give energy. 
Follow the feeling of needing to breathe. 

Wait what you have feelings. 
Every thought is… try to finish the sentence. 
It should be easier then it is to say it. Instead you curse. You auto respond to it unable to bring yourself to say it. 
Keep thinking maybe you’ll find something good. 

Your thoughts don’t see your face. 
You are too sensitive. You can’t not follow every feeling. 

The last thing is I can’t chill. 
Every thought is not a chill thought. 
You can’t chill because the thoughts are going fast. 
If you want to chill you have to think slowly. 
If you want to think you have to think fast. 
If you want to chill go slow. If you want to think go fast. 
Trying to think and go slow you won’t be able to chill. 
If you’re trying to chill you won’t be able to think. 
Talk fast. Or chill. 

When you’re trying to sleep and you think about moving it feels much more comfortable to stay still. 
When you have a thought it feels much more comfortable to stay. 

Build up enough energy to think faster. 
Meanwhile try to think whatever uses less energy. 

Sometimes you only got 1 second to decide. 
If I went fast. 
Mantra the word if. 

Every inhale and exhale changes the thought. Short breaths quicker thoughts. 
I breathe as little as if I were in a sewer trying to breathe as little as possible. 
The thoughts are reactionary not stationary. They are not waiting there and have that thought they are spawned when they react to something. 
The reactionary’s appears as though they are stationary. 

What’s holding you back. 
I do not know but maybe it’s. 
Heart pulse. 
Fear. 
Reaction thoughts. 
Rushing thoughts. 
Energy. 

Gasp after each thought. Like I’m on top of a ladder. 
More energy might help. If I had energy for a second. If I were to go fast for a second. 
Go fast. Or talk. 
What is holding you back. 
Energy

Conserve energy and breathe. 

Childhood me says I’m gonna forget. 
Traumas. 
If you want to think about it You are going to need more energy then the responding trauma thoughts. To raise your voice. 
Breathe. 
It feels like someone’s sitting in your chest. 
You have 20% strength you trauma has 100% strength. 
Argue with your trauma when you have more strength. 
Corner them and raise your voice. Curse them out.

Try to talk to measure energy level. 
My heart compolses with each breath. 
What causes this situation. Trauma. Cult. Brainwashing.

It’s a fight but I have no energy. 
No one can argue with you. 
I am healing from trauma. 
Smile to corner them. No energy to smile. 
PTSD. 

If I didn’t say it I don’t listen to it. 
Don’t blow holes in my thoughts. 
Thoughts don’t care about your feelings. 
There’s a new sheriff in town. 

There’s nothing you can remember you are going to forget everything. 
Try to figure out what to do. 

I forgot everything again. Even to breathe. 
Now what. 
Keep them on one thought. 

Acting is so embarrassing. 
Not talking for a while can make you forget who you are. 
When you forget everything your thoughts take you for a ride. You don’t want to be there you’re trying to avoid work strain that you don’t want to do at the moment. 
You’re going to forget and find yourself working again. 
Try finding chill thoughts. Or try to stop working. 

You’re still not convinced that what happened to you was fake. Try later when you’re stronger. 

It’s about going fast. 
Go fast and stop when available. 
Is the breathing thing real. 
You will have your turn. 

How to avoid work. 
Stay at one thought. 
Ask for a cigarette break. 

You can do it without changing how you breathe. 
Do what. 

There’s no such thing as brainstorming. 

Brute. 
Can you stay a brute. 
No. 
So make it easier on yourself or it’s a waste of time. 
Brute vs cute. 
You can be a brute but you can’t stay a brute. 
Maybe because you’re not really a brute or because you get confused. 
It might be mean being a brute if you’re not a brute. 
If you are a brute it’s ennyficent being a brute to yourself when you’re not a brute. 
Try to stay a brute. 

Minimal effort brute. 
You used to be a brute and think like a brute. 
Then you stopped and became not a brute and didn’t think like a brute. 
Now sometimes you’re a brute sometimes your not. 
When you’re not a brute your brute thoughts pick in you like when you used to think like a brute. 
So you’re not a brute so you are being brutted on. 
I don’t know what to do.  
Maybe sometimes be a brute so you stop being brutted on. Or figure out how to stop being a brute to yourself. 
You used to be a brute. 

Make thinking more enjoyable or you will keep hitting a nerve. 
Brute vs Nice. 

What to know if you’re gonna forget everything. 
Try to enjoy yourself. 
Brute breathing vs nice breathing. 

When I was younger I was doing things which kept me tougher. Like when you worked at the pizza store. Imagine taking orders. 

Maybe you are changing personalities like a schizophrenic. 
You have a tough personality and then you have a weak personality. 
It usually stay at the weak personality. Unless you talk. 
Weak like a tough man scared into being a little kid. 
So be tough or figure out how to not be scared of the scary stuff. 
Or what else. 

The personality I become is a weak terrified little kid surrounded by my tough personalities. 
Tough guys be more gentle. Weak guys be more tough. 
I’m tougher then I think I am. But I don’t know that when I’m in the weaker personality. 
The slower you go the weak we you think you are. 
Go faster to realize you’re stronger. 
They attack fast but don’t let you respond back fast. 
What to do when I go slow.
Say one word at a time. 
What to do about bullies. 

The last thing is. 
What to do when I go slow and surrounded by fast thoughts. 
If you’re not talking then breathe. 
It’s like playing red light green light. 

What to do when it’s the feeling of stop. 
Try not to say more then the first word of a thought. 
Try not to stop. 
Stop until you think you found something worth talking.  
When you stop It moves fast try to keep up. 
Avoid triggers. Hard to stay stopped when dealing with a trigger. 
Stay on one thought. 
If you don’t talk you get bullied. 
When you don’t talk you become very young until you talk. But if you don’t talk and become young then the sound of a thought sounds like someone older then you forgetting that it’s you because your not talking. 

Don’t talk but be fast. 
Try not to get bored. 
Thinking like a baby before words. 

When moving around and it’s stop time then try to stick to the first word of one thought. 

Really yummy eyes are moving back and force really fast always. That’s why I can’t say a word before I get interrupted by my eyes flying back and forth. 
My eyes move back and forth really fast like I’m switching personalities really fast with every eye movement going to focus where that personality is. 
Going so fast like trying to build and catch a adrenaline rush and when you start to think in middle of a build up we get stopped because that will feel like a huge adrenaline buildup crash. 
We cut off thoughts at the point of their reminiscing energy return. 

The last thing. 
What to know when you’re gonna forget everything. 
Move your eyes around fast. 

It’s like all your personalities are talking really fast between themselves and using your eyes when they talk. 
And they must stop and go slow at every scary thought. 
I think going really fast for a bit helps you go slow afterwards. 

The last thing. 
How to slow down your thoughts. 
Maybe if we go fast for long enough we can drain it out. 

Maybe you’re in a state of shock for months. 
Maybe they are not thoughts but reactions. 
Maybe try asking a question like shall we have a cigarette. 
Different reactions from the masses. 
Maybe it’s just your heart beat or blood rushing. 

The last thing. 
You’re still not convinced it was fake. Like Times Square. 
Try to convince yourself it was fake. 

If we don’t know then No one knows why are eyes are moving so fast.

I don’t know so no one know if we need to change how we breathe. 
I think because are eyes move so fast we don’t breathe right. 

What to know when you forget everything. 
Breathe fast. Breathe as fast as you move your eyes. 

Don’t be taking kind advice from the ruthless thoughts in your head. 
As a man You wanna be as ugly as possible. 
Trying to change thoughts feels like changing the train of thought abruptly. 
Don’t take advice from stray thoughts. 
Some thoughts I can’t say with the brute voice like if it has feeling. 
Everyone stops to listen to a sweet voice. 
I’m a sucker for sweet personalities. 
Any nice words I say with the non brute voice. 

Energy. 
Talk. 
Breathe. 
Eyes. 

If I say something the brute won’t say it will defend itself. 
What is the feelings you feel that make your eyes move. 
Maybe personalities. 
If we say something nice the brute says what. 
If we say something not nice the nice says what. 
They say what if I get sidetracked. 
Maybe breathing in switches to a specific personality and also when I breathe out. 
You think you are someone that must listen. No confidence or self esteem. Weak and worthless. Ugly and stupid. 
Worried about what others think and must get their reassurance. 
Shy. 

Brute vs Shy. 
Buffalo vs New Jersey. 

I’ve always been shy so where are the nine shy voices from. Maybe from Morristown. 

Shy unloved abandoned neglected brainwashed traumatized lone wolf. 
Shy listening to all the not shy voices. 
Suppressing my bruteness. 
My bruteness bullies me when I’m shy. 

They broke me as a kid so I would listen and be more easily brainwashed and conditioned. 
I used to be a troublemaker till high school. 
Then I became shy. When it was about looking good in a mirror and losing weight and cool friends.
And maybe also because of the screaming principal while all alone in boarding school. 

I have always been shy when talking in real life. 
But for some time I wasn’t shy when talking in my head.
But when I worked on mars I wasn’t shy talking in my head. Or when I was in Morristown. 
Alone I was very not shy. 
But then Maybe the past couple months made you more shy being so scared to have any thought. 

I can talk in very not shy voices. But I cut myself off because im shy. And interrupt myself because im shy. 
And can’t do what I want to do because I gotta check first for approval because im shy. 

Abandoned helpless terrified shy kitten. 
What to do for shy. 
I’m shy and a brute. 
When I’m cornered and unable to move I’m shy. Once I move I’m a brute. 

Shy. Maybe from child abuse. 
We overload our shy feelings and put on a beard and became a brute over night. 
We became who we hated our untied life in order to get stronger then them and what they did to our brain. 
I was too shy to handle conspiracy theories so I had to become a brute to stop tripping. 
Then after 3 years I tried to retrieve my shy feelings but then my brute started bullying my shyness. 
Then I became more shy on purpose to be more sensitive and nice. 
Shy while resting. Don’t wake me up. 
Shy conserves energy. 
You wear a beard when you think. 

Not talking help me conserve my energy but I become shy and can’t respond. 
When I talk I’m not shy but I use my energy. 
I can’t do anything wrong. But shy thinks he’s always doing something wrong. 
Shy rests. Brute talks. 
2 second rest then a thought that wakes you up then repeats. 
Don’t think it’s not going fast. 
Thinking fast while trying to avoid waking ourselves up. 

The brute sleeps shy takes over. The brute is always sleeping. I’m too exhausted to use my brute energy. 
But enough energy to have a intruding brute force but to exhausted to respond brutefully. 
Too exhausted to defend my shy feelings and too exhausted to ignore them. 
Shy thinks he’s 15. 
Religion is child abuse. 
Wtf is holy and how is it legal. 

Finally not shy. 
Is my heart feeling emotions without me. 
Say stop. 
Shadow work. 
Every thought begins with being shy. 
Because you’re shy and your thoughts are not shy it creates the atmosphere like people are talking to you. 
Because you’re shy your eyes dart towards every thought. 
Lots of topics are nerve wracking because you’re shy. 
Maybe what you feel is your nerves. 
Breathing makes your eyes dart more. 
You’re trying not to think. 

It seems it’s great efficiency to talk in general to know who you are and maybe more efficient to figure out what to talk about specifically.

It’s difficult to think. 
I feel something strange. 
I get scared.

Who’s pressuring you. No one. My brute side. Myself. 
Conflicting feelings. 
Trauma. Shy. Heal. Brute. 

Talk at your own pace. 
Talk when you can feel like it. 
Find any excuse to talk. 
It makes sense that the better you breathe the better you think. 
When you’re shy it’s harder to laugh. 
It’s natural to think that but who I’m I saying that to. Shy.

Talking feels great.

What to do if you’re gonna forget everything.

It might just be for the first impression to your self. 

How is the school legal. 
They got good lawyers. 

You don’t talk because you’re trying to watch tv. 
Maybe there’s a middle ground. 
We haven’t talked in 9 months. 
Cut yourself some slack. 

I haven’t talked in 9 months. 
What do I make of that. 

I talk so little that I wonder what’s worth talking about when you do.
Like what. 
Like something that would help me when I’m not talking. 
Can I sit still and talk or just talk somehow or read. 
Why can’t I sit still. 
Try 1 minute. 
It’s painful. 
Maybe withdrawal. 
Talking hurts. 
I think it hurts less if I follow the feelings. 

The last thing. 
It hurts to sit still. 

You’re constantly saying aahhh it hurts. 
Sue them for overdosing you. 

I might be under the false impression that every thought scares me. It might just be every thought hurts because I’m already in pain and thoughts just interrupt my healing rest.
I can’t sit still and think slowly when my mind is racing and I get bored fast and restless. 
Try 1 minute at a time. 

First it hurt and I vented the pain. 
Then it got too boring to stay. 
Maybe breathing will help it more. 
No one know something you don’t know. 

Just try to talk as much as you can whenever. 
I don’t know why but I think it’s a good idea. 
I only talk when I’m not watching tv.

Do the short thinking till you’re in the middle of a conversation then you will have something to talk about. 

Just say yeah yeah yeah to the same thing. 

You might think like an adult but you feelings and emotions might be that of a kids. 

What would a thought sound like if you weee talking to yourself. 
Maybe you’re fruity. 
One thought many perspectives. 
You pretend like you’re not thinking. I think that creates confusion. 

My heart hurts. 
Maybe it’s because of the new rougher situation where we are talking and breathing more and it’s getting used to it. 

Pretend like you’re thinking.
We don’t always have an answer for every thought. 
Maybe try to know what you want without thinking. 
Maybe try acting out the characters in you head in real life. 

Pick your self up. 
Talk. 
What happens when you don’t pick yourself up. 
I get confused. 
Man down. 

It’s difficult to change the way your voice sounds in your head. 
It could be you’re cutting off the thought because you want to change the way it sounds. 
It might be out of your comfort zone to talk the way you think. 
Repeat your last sentence. 
Stop getting embarrassed. 

The thoughts voices make it sound that it’s dramatic. 
Maybe your voice will make it sound less dramatic. 
What else. 
We can’t pick ourself up even if we talk. 

Talk in your fallback voice. Because you always get stuck there. 
You’re listening instead of talking. 
The more we talk in our fall back voice the better it is for picking yourself up. 
Pick yourself up from your fallback voice. 
Stop listening. 

Rough world for a soft guy. 
Sometimes I’m soft sometimes I’m hard. Bi.

Breathe soft. 
Get used to switching between soft and hard. 
Get used to talking soft then hard. 
What about how weird it sounds. 
Confusion is real when you get ahead of yourself when you drastically change between hard and soft. 
When you change between soft and hard  you change personalities. 
Confusion is real. 
Sometimes it goes faster then you can. 

Soft: is it done yet. 
Hard: is it done yet. 

Hard: sometimes it goes faster then you and confuses you. 
Once it goes slow it will be done. 

How would you read something to yourself. 

When it goes faster then you you get confused and ahead of yourself.

We worry so much. 
Breathe with you stomach. 

Because it’s happens by it self you smart to do it on purpose. Switching between soft and hard voice. 
It’s fun to talk soft and there’s not a lot to do. 
The voice of my thought determines my personality. 
Our thoughts jump ahead of us and feel like a personality. 
Ignoring a thought voice creates confusion. 
There’s the soft voice and there’s a hard voice and maybe there’s a middle voice that you would use if you could choose. 
Maybe we got to play along to avoid confusion. 
Maybe we gotta get used to using the different voices and personalities. 

You got schizophrenia with delusional paranoia. 
Have fun with the personalities. 
Fast or slow. Soft or hard. 
If it hurts at least slow down your thoughts and or make the hurting face. And breathe.

Every thought is followed by the breathe impulse. 
Crickets. 
I’m not that weak. 
You can’t use the older voices on demand. 
I can make the kids voice on demand. 
What voice do you read with. Older voice. 
My thinking voice should probably be similar to my reading voice. 
What voice would you choose. 

All your thoughts are in 3rd person and I can’t stomach speaking in 3rd person. 
You can’t speak confidentially so you catch finish a thought. 
It hurts to switch positions and talk. 
All thoughts get cut off and hurt when I’m in pain. 
Make the hurt face. 

Who makes the decisions around here. 
I think the kid does. 
How can a weak kid make a decision when all his thoughts are stronger adults trying to convince what to do. 
You’re a kid when you’re not thinking a thought. 
Be stronger and do what you want. 
Ignore the pain. 
My whole heart flinches every beat. 
My blood pumps make my eyes flick. 
What’s wrong with me. 
I should be really strong by now. 
Maybe I legitimately have multiple personalities like schizophrenia. 
Maybe it’s actually heavy switching between them or having to respond to them. 
Which personality chooses things. 
Those micro thoughts really get to me. 
I’m a athlete. But I forget. 
We use the older voices for problem solving. Maybe they use a specific face to talk. 
Whatever resonates with you at the moment. 
Maybe the thoughts are repulsive. 
The blood pulse is really strong on each beat. 
The blood heart beat around the body is really intense cutting off every thought I have. 
I feel ashamed about each thought. 
Maybe some of us are sensitive. 
It’s not a safe place for feelings. 
I’m like the hardest and the softest. 
I can’t be rude. 
Maybe it’s the sudden shift of vibes that’s uncomfortable. 
Move the eyes to stay in the vibe. 
Maybe fucking curse more to fucking see this fucking side of us. 
What’s my pallet. 
The voice of the thoughts sound very unexpected. 
One thought think the next one judges it. 
It’s like thinking what others think about you. 
When you hear a kids voice and it grabs your heart you think you must listen. 
I think it keeps switching between heart then brain. 
I’m trying to do what I want but the heart and the brain feel like I should see if they want to first. 
Afraid to be mean afraid to ignore. 
My feelings might be fucked. 
We shouldn’t be feeling guilty no matter what we choose to do. 
Feelings aren’t aware of the situation they just have a feelings about things. 
I’m aware. No one else is aware. No guilt no shame. 
I’m the only one aware here. 
Question coming from a awareless sentence or feeling. 
The micro thoughts are unaware. When we talk we are aware. 
Hello awarlesses. 
Afraid to commit to any facial expression. 
How would you describe the serious thinking voice. 
What else. 

What idk something. 
Its Probably about the way you think. 

Maybe we should say we and us more often instead of you and he. 

Keeps your eyes at a resting position then look up when you have a thought. 

I endured school I wonder if I still feel bad about it. 
13 years of traumatizing school growing up doesn’t just disappear.
The feelings and memories resurfaced at 18 once we were out of school. 
We decided to go back to know we were right.  
To know we were right about how abusive messed up traumatizing awful terrible illegal child abuse brainwashing cult conditioning it was. Especially if you tried to resist. 
But we weren’t sure. We were to young dumb and messed up by them to be able to tell for sure. 
We couldn’t just let it go. 

Maybe this wasn’t all for nothing and explains everything. 
If you try to resist your brainwashing you get schizophrenia. 
Those who resisted more growing up got more traumatized. 
It’s less traumatizing to the kids that behaved to the brainwashing. 
School we didn’t ask what did it do to us. 
My Feelings vs brainwashing. 
Is it as psychologically damaging as a cult. 
I don’t stand a chance arguing against the tons of brainwashing vs the little information I have. 

Did school give us mental issues. 
Dreaming of getting out for years. 18 just out of school. what the hell was that. What can we do about it. 
Maybe get closure. 
Maybe expose them. 

If we want to be sure about it we aren’t going to be convinced easily. 
At least we have something to talk about. 
I want to get intube with my feelings and see what I feel about it. 



Stop explaining yourself to awarelessnesses. 

It would be a piece of cake if my thoughts went slow. 
It all begins with uhm. 
Cognitive dissidents is recommended. 
Stick to one side for a second longer. 
Repeat every thought. 
Try to get the last one. 
She’ll be coming around the mountain when she comes. 
Ight. 
Why can’t you cry. 
I scroll through my thoughts like I scroll through TikTok cutting them all off early. 

This topic has a lot. 
Let’s begin by 1st grade. 

Brain is stuffed. 
Maybe try meditating and build up breathing. 
Maybe try TikTok while stuffed. 

Each time I switch between a man and a kid it hurts to sudden shift. 
Make the vibe comfy. 
Close your eyes and Control the vibe with your eyes or face or something. 
I think it tickles. 
Control your forehead. 
Keep guessing. 
Keep guessing what. 
You’re arguing with a sociopath. 
You have to choose between two of them.
Maybe I’m out of energy. 
Maybe it’s something about the way I think. 
Maybe I’m trying to figure out how to think better. 
Maybe I’m trying to figure out what the situation is. 

Get pissed off at thoughts to stop racing thoughts. 
Maybe there’s a pissed off face. 
The angry face doesn’t want to do anything. 
Keep your mouth closed when angry. 
Try to think with your own voice. 

We are always trying to figure out how to go correctly with my feelings. 
React correctly to every situation. 
You gotta make the correct face to react correctly. 
Discuss gay. 
I don’t wanna talk about it. 
What’s the spinning feeling. 
We can’t ignore the spinning feeling it’s very intense. 
Short breathes is more accurate feeling. 
You interrupt yourself to stay on train of thought. 

Instead of getting pissed you say yea whatever. 
Because you don’t get pissed you have to continue. 
Breathe through your nose with your mouth open. 
Your thoughts can’t speak slowly.
I’m such a push over. 
Say what you want. 
It’s easier to say what’s bad then to say something good. 
How do I get pissed off. 
Give up or start trying. Squint your eyes. 
Look at your heart. 
Make the give up face. 
When you give up breathe. 
I think my heart is healed. 
Focus on the center of the feeling. 
Perfectionist. 
Stuff your brain up. 
You either gotta think fast or talk slow. 
I’m not in the mood of either. 
You gotta know what you’re in the mood of. 
You always gotta be thinking just how fast. 
Slow head movements towards new thoughts. 
Our mind wonders then refocus it. 
It would go slower if we didn’t think behind our backs. 
I’m busting at the seems. 
Slow movements. 
Make better imaginations of your thoughts. 
Fomo. 
No worried thoughts. 
Gotta merge the fast and slow thoughts to get a proper dialogue. 

Proper dialogue. 
Slower. 
Shake it off. 
Use your hands. 
Make eye contact. Open your eyes. 
Say I don’t wanna then say I wanna. 
Do what you want. 
Proper vent. 
Any thoughts you do wanna think about. In the mood of. 
Maybe you have to explain each thought. 
I’ll just wait for something good to talk about. 
It’s easier to answer then to ignore. 
Make it enjoyable to answer. 
Give up giving up. 
I’m so bored. 
What’s not a distraction. 
There’s nothing I want to do except learn.
Maybe coding. 
Maybe videos
Maybe work. 
Maybe walk. 
Maybe video games. 
Maybe music. 
Maybe writing. 
Maybe meditate. 

When you have to decide think about both options.
Think what to do next. 
Think about sitting in bed. 
Think about thinking.

Sometimes you can’t decide. 
Try slipping away. 
Maybe third eye. Like your gut feeling. 
Maybe you’re thinking more then one thing at a time. 
The point of Diminishing return. 
Stop resisting. 
It should be easier now because it’s less of a shock. 
It’s easier now because my brain isn’t stuffed. 
Look up when you think. 
Stop the streak. 
Make the scared face. 
Like every decision is huge. 
Constant worried thoughts constant worried face. 
Shake it off. 
Try cry breathing. 
Like it’s someone else. 
I’m so tired I don’t want to use the energy to think about it. 
Maybe figure out the personalities. 
I would rather do the wrong thing then to fall for it. 
Cool vs gay. 

I have nothing to say. 
I could say something but it feels like I’m interrupting myself. 
I don’t know what it is but it feels cool. 
I’m still deciding. 
Hold your breath to speed it up. 
Release energy from below. 
How do i know who I am if I never say anything. 
You’re so used to stopping thoughts that you stop your own thoughts. 
Don’t fall for bullshit. 
Stick to one ball. 
Let your eyes wonder. 
Just say no. 
It’s just thoughts. 
Like my brain has a mind of its own. Like impulses. 
Like my feelings have a mind of its own. Like impulses. 
Building up strength. 
Move your tongue when you talk. 


Neglected. 
Don’t know how to say no. 
I hate school I don’t wanna go to school. 
It don’t matter what you want. 


What’s at the end of the rainbow. 
Maybe gay. 

Worried racing thoughts make worried face. 

One problem. 
Racing worried thoughts stuffed brain. 
One solution. 
Buildup breathing and control the vibe make worried face.


What to think about. 

What type of person am I. 
What are my feelings like. 
What does my voice sound like. 

Talk every once in a while. 

We are arguing what we want. 
Spend time being the one that says no and follow our eyes. 
They are just thoughts. I won’t let it be anything else. 

It’s in a little boy then I’m a big boy. 
But it’s always the same what I want. 
Me and thoughts.  

I wouldn’t say this so it’s proof of some instinctual personality. 
A smart one thinks but doesn’t answer. 

My instinctual personality is gay or childish or something. 
If I speak with a different voice it’s not my feelings. 

It’s just a thought. 
But is it just a feeling. 

Why are our thoughts so bad. Probably childhood. 
Passive and active. 

What to think about. 
Screenplay. 
Love yourself. 
All equally boring. 

As strong as the animal. 
As tired as the sloth. 
Jump like a kangaroo. 

What makes you say what. 
Random rhymes and not words. 
Beatbox. 
How do I make it look like I am thinking. 
I think move your eyes in the direction of the thought. 

You’re resisting letting your eyes get moved. 
Thinking face. Think like a kid. It’s going to be disorienting after thinking. 
Natural reaction face. 

Thoughts distract you from your feelings. 
Discover faces. 
It feels like I’m on helium. 
We always think the opposite of what we say. 
Count to 10 in a whisper to be the kid. 
Count to 10 out loud to be the man. 
The response to anything is initially no then you have to repeat it to continue. 
G and gg. 
Listen to music. 
Make the thinking kid face. 
Make the thinking adult face. 
I’m stuck being a kid. I don’t how to switch back to a adult. 
Split personality disorder. 
A adult when I think and a kid when I stop thinking. 
Being a kid doesn’t just go away. Google photos. 
In a way. 
So…

Breathe. 
Maybe the irritation will go away after a shower. 
I say no when I move away from the feeling game. 
Who am I right now. 
You can tell who you are currently by how you would interact with someone. 
It’s difficult to think because my personalities react to my thoughts. 
Sometimes I think I’m a kid stuck in a man’s body sometimes I think I’m a man stuck in a kid’s body.
We are both like gay and straight like bi. Popular queens people are trying to figure out about themselves these days. 
Don’t let it just be your thoughts that are gay be gay as well. 
Same thinking different feeling
I’m miserable as an adult. The kid makes me smile. 
Everyone makes me smile. 
Maybe it’s the same one person when I’m happy. 
Maybe when you don’t have emotion you’re a man and when you have any emotion or feeling you’re a kid. 
A man when tired a kid when not tired. 
When I’m tired I try till it’s difficult then I give up. 

Why is it always what not to think of next. 
It’s just my feelings. 

School destroys feelings and makes you dissociate. 
Everyone knows that and that’s why your feelings stay young. So you might be a 6 year old emotionally and a 60 year old mentally. 
My eyes are just trying to rest. 
When tired keep your eyes close and down. But leave room for thoughts.  
Maybe breathe for more energy. 
Like the joining the army at 6 years old.
That’s the trip you’re going with. It’s home. 
The drill Sergeant is still screaming. 
Now maneuver through your feelings. 
Closure. 

Certainty is my kryptonite. 
Two sides to ourself. 
With feelings. Without feelings. 
Feelings don’t just change because we thought of something. 
You’ll mnow it’s over when you can say we are done. 
When tired use the upset face. 
Is there one face that the feeling is. 

Some decisions take more then a split second to decide. 
Maybe third eye game.
Special thoughts skip a step. 
The game used to be how long can you forget you’re a tired 60 year old. 
It’s go go go tired go go go tired… tantrum. 
Wanna make sure a thought is legit and not a trip. 

You gotta figure out what your thoughts are. 
Whatever is easiest. 
Because it can’t land on a specific face it has to keep on going. 
If you want to figure something out make the discovery face. 
Make the frustrated face. And Breathe frustratedly. 

Which face should I make. 
Talk very specifically. 
One sec. 
Wow.  

The feeling game. 

Verify and quit. 

17 days till I turn 26. 

Obviously to anything out of the ordinary going on. 
Can I… 
If it’s it it will be. 

Cognitive dissidents. 
Which face is gershon. 
gershon. Gershon. 6. 19. 25. 

Think perifialy like a ball in the hoop. 
Mebye brainstorming is real. 
Maybe keep your eyes down. 
Sometimes the easier answer is the wrong one. 
You’re making me have to use cognitive dissidents. 

Talk specifically to know which face to use. 
Peripheral maintains dissidents. 
Third eye. 
Pretend like your subconscious is talking to you. 
Quantum fluctuations thoughts. 
Maybe it’s the puberty feeling that you’re trying to figure out. 
Sexual healing. 
I’ve never enjoyed things passively. 
Maybe we can’t make the turned on face. 
Why no blood rushing down. 
I think all your sexual energy is stuck stuffed in your brain. 
Stick to one bubble and try to make it bigger. 
We stood up for ourself. 
Our pulse is too slow to be having racing thoughts but there are fast intruding interrupting thoughts. 
Push the energy as you exhale. 
Follow the energy and let your eyes open wide. 
It’s like the juice is dripping into being a thought. Supply more juice. 

Totally sarcastic. 
Empathize with your feelings voice. 
Subconscious and sub feeling. 
You can’t do anything wrong. 

Which face should I make. 
Cognitive dissidents.
Any one can use be the 60 year old or the 6 year. 
Listen to the fan. 

Sexual healing. 
How are we going to make money. 

OCD. 
You win some you loose some. 
Anything not composed startles me at first. 
What’s my personality. 
Which face should I make. 

What are we trying to figure out. 
It’s getting slower. 
We think of everything not anything in specific.
We always choose the toughest one impulsively. 
Must figure out how to maneuver from the passive stance. 

Think about your thoughts. 
The missing face is the happy face. 

They are contradictory personalities. 
You’re excited. 
Thinking shouldn’t need my input. 
Input fast. 
Maybe make it a story. 
6 to 60 loop. 
Find a way to have fun. 
What to do recursion. 
Maybe it’s recursion of asking what to do and can’t think of anything to do. 

Recursion. 
What would help right now. 
I can’t just move on to the next thought. 
At the speed of mood. 
Not in the mood of thinking. 
The feeling game is the feeling of needing to move. 
I gotta go roller blading. 
The feeling game is about where to move your jaw or eyes. 
Your subconscious can only talk to you peripherally. 
My cognitive dissidents didn’t work. 
Beware of trolls. 

Every thought is a distraction from the thought I need to go roller blading. 
Your thoughts are natural like roller blading. 
Vent the I gotta feeling. 
Maybe try calling a name to be that personality. 
I can’t women here but I can get cute. 
It’s like a ventriloquist but how much you input. 
I gotta go is getting converted into an opposing thought. 
Does before have anything go to do with what’s going on now. 
Don’t think about it will just confuse you. 

Gotta go. 
Hang out with people. 
We are a mixture of a lot of different personalities. 
You gotta go faster to keep up with yourself who’s restless. 
Like composer vs feelings. 
When your restlessness is dragged out it becomes a little kid. 
One day no energy the next day lots of energy. 

Juicer. 
What a juice thought. 
There aren’t any. 
So don’t stop.
Can’t not stop. 
You will always end up at juice. 
Say fast. 
Make room for a womens face. 
Practice your right eye. 
Don’t do the Turing test. 
You’re implying we should do a turing test.  
Exhale like your trying to figure something out. 
A women slowed it down. 
You are always going to end up at forgetting everything. 
Go ahead. 

Everything is a distraction from breathing. 
Nothing will help. 
What’s a good one. 
Act the way you look. 
I used to look like that. 
There’s an intense pressure making it difficult to breathe. 

You doubt the words you say. 
What to do. 
When you’re bored maybe switch personalities. 
And the feeling game. 
At least it doesn’t hurt. Getting used to it not hurting. 
Make the face of the mood you’re in. 
Listen to your thoughts and find a distressed voice and help vent that face. 
The game waiting to see what my actual personality is. 
Say sshhh to worried thoughts. 
Maybe you gotta stop playing the feeling game. 
Try to take things not literally. 
You don’t protest anything. 
Slight smile face. 

Write out to vent 
PTSD of someone dropping in. 
Does breathing better help anything. 
Let passive be the one being. 
How can you tell if you’re passive or active. 
The end will be when’s there’s  just a kid doing nothing with nobody. 

Keep guessing. 
The feeling game is how passive you can be. 
It has the same friction as a conversation. 
Let passive answer everything. 
The technical issues of machine learning. 
When you forget your older you are younger. 
Be active when you want to think. Yum
Be one or the other not half assing it. 
You culture shock each other. 
The feeling game is my feelings. 
You always say ehh. 
Diplomatic immunity. 
Say ouch when it switches fast. 
Maybe try breathing. 
The feelings make my left thumb tense up. 
Implying. 
If I was playing dirty I would say patients. 
Practice your left eye. 
What’s not a gimmick. 
Pink elephant. 


It will be over when you hear crickets. 
You will always return to what to do. 
If you’re not going to pretend like you’re talking at least pretend like you’re listening. 
It’s a lose lose. 
Deep thinker sometimes you just gotta run with a feeling to make small talk. 
One day I’m going to figure out how to make you laugh. 
Maybe I really got to breathe better. 
It made you not be able to stop thinking. 
Very creative. 
Maybe try saying our name Gershon or Jason. 
The louder voice wins. 
Desperate deep thinker. 
Improve. 
Dizzy. 
Implying. 
Inhale like through a straw. 
Tired mantra. Conserve energy. 
Think about the future. 
They are just a thought. 
My eyes keep flickering because of the heart pulse. 
I can’t rest my eyes. 
Blink fast. 
Keep your eyes open they they don’t get shocked by every pulse. 
Keep your eyes low so they don’t get shocked by every pulse. 
Open closed breathe fast. 

What at the end of the rainbow. 
Maybe life. 
Feelings don’t lie. 
Dance with your eyes. 

Keep yourself stimulated. 
It’s the only important thing. 
It’s like playing chess against myself. 
It’s the vibe. 
Good vibes. 
Vibe diplomat. 
Which face or voice or vibe do you want for your first impression.
But I do but I don’t. 
Breathe through your mouth. 
No patients vibe. 
Air phones. 
Disoriented. 
Who do we have to go through to run things. 
I am disoriented. 
What is oriented. 
Gotta go fast to stay oriented.

Gotta land sometime. 

Only if it works right away. 
Stop playing the feeling game. 
If you’re not gonna breathe better breathe faster. 
One second you’re in dubstep the next you’re in Mozart.

Gay childish Jewish or what. 
Explain being 25 and immature. It’s a mood. 
Instead of getting angry I become immature. 
Maybe it’s asking the right questions is the answer.

Be angry. 
If we talk in a tone it is fun. 
If we were schizophrenic we would want to know our personalities.
